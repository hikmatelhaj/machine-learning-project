review
"Had the ribs....terrible. 
Imagine chewing on shoe leather. 
Come to Gent on business often. Won't be back."
"Ate there twice in ten years. The first time my bowels got upset. The second time, again. I’ll never visit this place again. As a bonus, very expensive for a tiny pita."
"Okay. Let me start by saying that I went to the old Bloch. Let me add this: This isn't it. This Bloch is just a name build on an old shop. And that's it. I ordered a slice of chocolate cake. Now I love chocolate cake and eat and have eaten a lot of it. Seriously a lot. So much it cannot be measure by normal standards. Now how does this 6 euro slice of chocolate cake compares to all the rest?It was the WORST chocolate cake I tasted in years. Specially for that price. What a bloody ripoff. Seriously cafe Theater, kick Bloch out of there cuz they will make you lose money. Tried a few other things such as a bolus, which was dry and awful. As we are discussing Bloch. They also sell their stuff at the Delhaize. Forget about those too. They taste awful most of the time. Dry and in past experiences had to throw most of it away as it was uneatable."
"My wife and I ordered 2 burgers, they took 30 mins to arrive, they were undercooked and were almost inedible, accompanying salad very poor. 

Not cheap, €40 - for 2 burgers, small beer and coke"
 Kids wanted Italian so we stopped at this restaurant. It was empty not even one customer. The owner said just kids can’t eat and didn’t allow us to sit. “Whoever sits got to order individual main course is policy” please don’t sit here. Said take the take away but you are not allowed to sit. completely empty restaurant but parents can’t support kids if they just want to order for kids. so we took the take away and sat in restaurant next to it where we ordered all food. Wonder why it’s an empty restaurant all the time. 
"Visited with a group of 15, and we had a preordered fixed meal. No fancy orders, nothing complicated. One appetiser & one main x 15. The appetixer, six slices of bread with three toppings came after 15'. The main, pasta 3 ways, came after 90'. It was not exceptional, great or even pleasant. A very average dish, with a monumentally slow unfriendly service. A joke of a place, there about 500 better restaurants to eat in Ghent. Do yourselves a favour and choose ANY other..."
"We were turned away at the door, though there were open tables we were told there was no room without a reservation. I completely understood but as we left we watched a couple discuss the menu outside and walk in. They were accepted and seated right away without a reservation. "
My wife and I visited for coffee before visiting the nearby church to see the Van Eyke Lamb of God altar pieces (as seen in the movie Monuments Men) The waiter was vulgar and offensive. I’m disabled and he knocked over my Mobility Rollator and shrugged his shoulders and walked away. I said I hope you haven’t broken out souvenirs and he was again really rude. We were polite at all times and gave him no reason to behave so rudely. Please avoid this place!
"Worst lunch experience ever. We waited 45 minutes before wondering when we would got some food. And after asking we had to wait 10 more minutes. We finally ended up with empty stomachs and a 7,5 EUR bill for two (not even cold) soda's. And the place wasn't even fully crowded. So, I hope in the future they will let their customers know in advance they have to wait a bit more than other food tents."
"We went here after a nice day in the sun, at first all was good but it started with dry pasta and chewy mozzarella. We werent even asked if everything was okay and when we asked to split the bill things went bad. The waiter shouted at us and was full on rude. They were not flexible at all and without proper explanation just went full on at us telling us that we were rude and dumb. Do not go here."
"Food had definitely no taste, every dish was too much expensive and the waiters treated us really bad. Moreover when I noticed that to the man at the counter he told me that she didn't need my suggestions to run the restaurant. I will never come there anymore. "
"Worst pizza hut i ever Been in  GHENT  
Impolite staff Ánd the timing for the food was terrible 
Rude staff …. I was there yesterday i’v been wating for food 1hour it is not normal i’m not coming there anymore"
"The food is not as good as you may expect in this restaurant and it's really really expensive. We went there a few times but never again. Every time there went multiple things wrong; we get wrong orders, not good cooked, argues with staff, .. I would deffinatly not recommend this restaurant to people who visit Gent."
"Touristic place with a bad service and bad food.We booked in advance and ended up in a corner like we were the last people arrived. It was so dark we could read the menu and we had to insist to get a light on our table. Food was touristic, not good at all. We got an average plate with a side gravy so salty that was impossible to eat it and a stew full of sugar. Don't go there, it's just a tourist trap."
We had a reservation for 18:30. We left at 20:30 and the dinner hadn’t been served. Nobody knew why we were overlooked. Terrible service. Not recommended at all.
"Firstly I am not a person that writes a reviews for restaurants, it's my first time. But I was compelled to by this horrible place. It was Monday and everything was closed around so we ended up here for a ""quick"" pizza dinner. We waited more than one hour for a 15 euros mediocre pizza with 3 slices of pepperoni and instead of serving customer that we were already in the restaurant they kept on bringing new from outside. Waiters were very unprofessional and he told me to understand him because it was not his fault as he was only a worker and I had to be patient. Worst of the worst.Thanks"
"The food was ok, nothing special. Service, however, was horrific. Took hours for someone to come to our table. I do not recommend, unless you have plenty of spare time and do not mind the bad service..."
"Waited an hour and 20 minutes for a pizza and two drinks that didn’t arrive. The restaurant was understaffed, and the few wait staff on hand were either incompetent or disinterested (in some cases, both). The only plus is the location and view, although that can be enjoyed for free just a few feet away."
"This restaurant is a joke. Service was fast, but that's about it.Children got a ham/cheese pasta dish that tasted like milk with flower (there was no cheese flavor whatsoever). The vegetarian pasta dish of my wife was based on... canned vegetables. There should be a law against this.My ""brochette"" meat dish was ok, sauses again from cans, with bad french fries.We visite restaurant throughout Belgium about once a week, and as far as we can remember, this is the worst food we've had at this price. To be avoided.Either go to any of the other restaurants on the main square (who serve ""acceptable"" food), or drive 3 km further, and go to ""Het Verschil"" to be truly amazed with quality food."
"Ordered through deliveroo on the 31st of December as everything was closed in the city of Ghent. First the food came 20 min later. That's alright. It can happen. What cannot happen is ordering for over 50 euros and get soaked, moist fries and cold burgers that were dry. We had to throw everything away as it wasn't edible anymore.Thank you Ellis. You really don't cease to disappoint. At this point I don't even know why I keep coming to your restaurant."
"Great location with nice weather, but worst service ever. Hospitality from the lady was pure hostile!!!!"
This review has been written while we are waiting for our meal. We are still waiting for a pizza (waiting time more than 1h at the moment). No further comments are needed. Slower service on earth. Good luck to clients who have plans later. Wouldn't recommend to anyone
"Shabby service, lack of style in contrast with the beautiful surroundings. Small portions for a high price. Our first and last visit. "
"This restaurant appears to have it all right, the location and presentation of the restaurant is great and we took a reccomendation from the hotel we were staying at. The main issue is the service or the lack thereof. The manager was incredibly arrogant and rude, dissmissive, unattentive and did not even have the manners to listen to issue we had with the food. He had the opportunity to correct the issue but instead dealt with it in a manner which has resulted in my first ever tripadvisor post as i was so upset about the experience we had. We left the restaurant and the final night of our two week holiday on the continent with this awful experience and a bad taste in our mouths in more way than one - and over Euro100 worse off. Avoid this place for nothing more than dreadful customer service - the manager did not even have the guts to give me his name for fear of where or what i might choose to do with it!!!!"
"Weird place. Everything is perfect, except that the sole ordered was not the sole brought. First, we did not get the bill even asking for it three times. Second, the expensive see sole was charged, but this was not ordered. The standerd sole is served by three, but we only got one. When complaining, the excuse was that we were served with the sea sole, and therefore only got one. The excuse was that sole shrinks when preparing. Ok, but not with more than 50 %. Without any discussion, the manager threatened to call the police. Very strange. A pity we did not take a photograph of what what was actually served. To avoid waste of time, we paid the bill without fail. But please go there for a drink, it has a nice view over the river. But when you get your food, make sure to prepare photographic evidence and chrck your bill"
"We were hungry and it was a saterday evening. This restaurant had still a table free, we immediatly noticed that it was filled with tourists. Anyways we got offered a table cramped in between two other tables. When taking a quick look around we saw that there was dirt all over the floor. The bin where the waiters would put the leftover food in, was located next to one of the tables. The waiters were very loud, rude and unprofessional. One of them never knew where she should deliver the dish. They would put ice in glasses with their hands. I really doubt that this restaurant follows the hygenic standards imposed by the government. Furthermore, the food was not great. My dad ordered a steak medium rare and they gave him a well done piece of meat. Just avoid this restaurant at all cost."
I would never eat at this place again. We were served a so-called waterzooi with rotten potatoes - not a single one was edible. And a steak like a lump of cardboard. I wonder if they even have a trained chef here. Stay away!
Waiting there for 25 minutes and there was no ober for ordering. very disappointing & NOT RECOMMENDED.
"The good reviews on Tripadvisor and de location (near our hotel) were our reasons to make a reservation at Faim Fatale. During the day, we walked in to the restaurant. From the kitchen a man came walking into the hallway. While he, mumbling into his cell phone, came towards us, he asked in a most unfriendly way, what we wanted. He kept on walking, passed us and didn’t hardly listen to what we said. Still speaking in his phone he left the building. As he looked at our astonished faces he mumbled that the reservation was ok….. The first time in my life I didn’t show up after a reservation…."
I ordered fish and my mom steak. Fish was tasteless and overcooked and the steak had no flavor at all. Told the waiter about it but did not even offer to give us a discount. Will definitely not go back.
"Disappointed to say the least. Presentation of the place, staff and food all get top marks. Where it matters gets little sorry to say..Paying top price I expected what any person would. Staff - Sadly the service was very in consistant from upstairs to down stairs. Advise here - avoid going late as staff are tired and drained. Female blonde hair upstairs sets the scene (good luck trying to get a smile from her) tall guy at bar only angel in there. Thank you tall mister. Food - lacked flavour and minimal choice of food due to festival (apparently) had to visit Ellis burger after ! Price - not realistic to what you eat. Ambience- too squashed, toilets in weird location. "
"Entered the restaurant early on a thursday evening and first impression as we were shown to our table by waiter in a white jacket with gold lapels was quite positive. Downhill from that moment on! Ordered two different beers from him and when they eventually arrived after a good 20 minutes they were both exactly the same. Ordered 2 different chicken dishes from the menu. He did not ask my husband what he wanted to accompany the dish - apparently a choice of chips, sauté potatoes or new potatoes. When food eventually arrived and was literally ""thrown"" at us both plates were exactly the same even down to the puff pastry decoration! Food ok but nothing special. Ordered two more beers and yet another 15 minute wait. The restaurant was not busy - only about 4 other tables taken - but the waiter seemed to be rushing around ""in circles"" doing nothing. We tried to get his attention to get the bill but felt he was deliberately ignoring us. We eventually put on our coats and got up to leave and he then appeared with the bill which stated on it that we had 2 different chicken dishes and 2 different beers. Needless to say we did not leave a tip. Staff definitely need a lesson in customer service."
"We stopped here for a light bite to eat and a drink. We waited ages before we could flag someone down as no-one appeared to be looking up. Then when we did, we ordered a coffee, black tea and a portion of fries. 20 minutes later the order arrived. I still had lots of tea so my partner ordered another coffee with a different waiter. 10 minutes later he brought fries to us which we declined having not ordered a second lot. Another 15-20 minutes had passed and by this time I had finished my tea. Now began the task of trying to get the bill... After finally asking for the bill, we then had to wait another 15 minutes for them to bring it over. It was wrong. We asked the waitress to remove the second cup of coffee from the order as we never received it. She seemed friendly enough and apologised foe the mess up. There seemed little to no organisation in the day to day running of this business... Everyone was serving everywhere, people food was getting mixed up and that was what we witnessed that one day. "
"We had a business dinner and some of us ordered fish which came with muscles on the side, our Jewish colleagues cannot eat shell so we politely ask to remove them from the plates and bring them again. At this moment waiters got offensive and refused to do it, even challenged why couldn’t they eat it, unbelievable I was so ashamed. We tried to change some dishes and even agree to pay for them and the waiters were almost aggressive. Worst of all next day we contacted management and they said it was our fault. If you are thinking about it, choose other restaurant, there are plenty where you’ll be nicely treated."
Gave us wrong order and over charged us by €20 when we tried to get things corrected they argued and then still got it wrong the second time
"Me and my friends have been waiting for 40 minutes our orders......we have asked at the waiter if there was any problem, he disappeared in the kitchen without any news. After 10 more minutes without ANY FOODS (total:50minutes waiting!) we asked the bill for the drinks and left the restaurant.Very bad service and communication."
"Closed during open hours on Monday Aug 6, 13:45. Their timings here also reflects the board they have on their location, but there is a closed board."
"As they are situated near the canal and you get to enjoy nice views, you tend to choose this restaurant. It was quite a let down. We waited for almost 2 hours for our order which personally i think wouldn't take much time to cook as we ordered mostly seafood. The staff were also not attentive enough to ask us or tell us the status of our order and we had to follow-up twice. As we were eating, the others were already fixing the other tables and preparing to close. I hope they do something abt it & not just take advantage that their restaurant is in a good location. Food was just okay and didn't compensate for the long wait. "
"My girlfriend and I went there for lunch. My girlfriend didn‘t want a main dish because she wasn‘t that hungry. So we decided to order one main dish and a side dish to share with each other. Alongside the food, we wanted to order a coke and half a liter of wine. As we told this to the waitress, she immediatly claimed, in a unecessary rude way, that we had to order two main dishes and left without giving us a chance to maybe find a compromise. So we left."
Food was not tasty at all. Salad bar and dessert buffet was like a war zone. Bad maintained and extremely dirty. I can’t recommend this place at all.
"Twice visited, twice tremendously disappointed. Location is superb but food is terrible and far too expensive. Service is friendly ( some of them) but incompetent and at some points even incredibly unhygienic. We hope this location will be taken over soon again and by real professionals this time"
"Maybe mistaken, but i had a feeling that my food was from microwave and not “just from the oven”. Employees have no dress code, very confusing and not professional. WC are dirty."
"The Food was excellent but the Service was unfriendly and slow: it took them about half an hour to bring our beers and after another half an hour, the manager all of a sudden said that the table at which we were sitting was reserved and that we had to leave. At this stage, we had already ordered food! So they rushed us out at half past 8. Very unprofessional and rude, a really unpleasent experience. Only the food made up for it, which was good."
If you want to eat microwaved pasta then you should visit this place. This is not real Italian pasta. This is horrible over cooked microwaved pasta with greasy sauce. The service is poor and rude.
"TOURIST TRAP!
It used to be a nice place, but in the LAST YEAR they have doubled the prices and reduced the amount of food.
4 SMALL PIECES OF STOVERIJ = 22€. In any other restaurant in Gent you get a big pot for around...More"
it s expensive not friendly we wait so long for steak ( 50 min for steak ) if you are trouist dont go they like only flemish  people :(((((
I am never coming back here! Overhyped. The steak was so undercooked it started eating the salad. The whole place was just dirty. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'DON'T EAT HERE!'
"Very disappointing experience...After battling for the waiters attention -who we did get- but that still didn’t gave them a clue that we actually wanted to order, we got a Jasmin tea served. It had been lying around for at least an hour, judged by how cold it was. Afterwards I ordered ribs who didn’t seem cooked but I was willing to give it a chance until I saw it was basically raw inside. After a lot of waving we finally got to explain why I couldn’t eat uncooked ribs which she claimed to have remade. They seemed better, but they were drowning in a chemical sauce who was supposed to mask the fact that the meat wasn’t fresh. When I decided to eat only rice the responsable grabbed my full plate without even asking if I was finished. I had decided to make a comment when she would ask how everything went but even a simple question like that didn’t come to her mind. I am shocked by how such restaurants keep on surviving based on a lucky emplacement and tourists who don’t seem to feel the need of giving the review it surely deserves. "
"We received a different dish than ordered, and were charged the more expensive dish. The food was bland, with poorly fried greasy chips, poorly seasoned vegetables, and sauce from prepackaged can. This place is rapidly going downhill. Note - The waitress did not speak Dutch, quite a surprise in Ghent..."
Food is terrible and that's only the start.... Any sea food from this place will give you food poisoning. Drivers don't know where they are going and the kitchen doesn't read allergy notes be warned. Pizzas look like theyer trow together with someone's feet. Drivers refuse to drop at your house if you live in the city and will shout at you for not coming to meet them wherever they decide to drop off. If you don't follow theyer instructions (some double standard) there they will refuse to drop the pizza at all. Man augment could be replace by a much more professional person with experience. Drivers will even message your personal phone with treats to meet them after their shift to settle it one one one. Guys if your looking for a pizza in gent aviod this place like the plague. Much better alternative in the same price points is KingSlize pizza much better quality food and service.
My wife and me ordered a table on the pretty terrace and their (excellent) Market menu. We arrived at 6:50 pm and abruptly left at 9:45 pm (!) leaving the money for the menu on the table and without having seen the desert. We simply could not wait anymore. The service was horribly slow and impersonal. So if you come to Ghent just for good food but not to take a closer look at the wonderful city don't hesitate to order a table in that restaurant. Otherwise I suggest you pass your way and pick one of the other 100s of restaurants you'll find all along the river.
"About 40 minutes before closing time, we entered and asked if we could have a quick dinner."" No tuna left, but salmon yes !"" no problem for us ! I ordered miso, a salad and whatever sushi the chef could prepare, understanding that as late custumors, we should be thankful for whagever is possible. I said the chef could serve us whatever he wanted.We got the salad, miso , then ignored for 30 min... and then the bill (while still halfway our sake,ordered and humbly saved ( did not care to ask more ) to accompany our meal)I tried to talk and explain the misunderstanding. Meanwhile, they were still selling take aways.The only reply after was a loop of ""thank you goodbye""When we left, about an hour later, every other place was closed so we were forced to find some junk food.The staff was so rude, pretending to not understand, while we really tried to be easy and as less demanding as possible."
"I visited this restaurant with my family for a buffet dinner. First impression, the food was dry and cold - when asked the personal, they came back saying since they weren't much people, they cannot renew nor make it fresh. The vegetable Byriani smelled bad and spoiled, the chicken tandoori was dry and not well blended, the rest of the food was below average. On top, the naan we ordered from the kitchen didn't look like a naan. I will never return nor suggest anyone to go there unless they bring quality food and think about the customer than making money."
"I went here with a friend. The lamb yellow curry was so salty it was almost inedible. The other items were also too salty. My friend asked for an extra hot curry, and got a mild one. We both felt unwell after the meal, and my friend vomited. The food was very oily and nothing to write home about. The only thing this place has going for it is the location. Needless to say we won't be going again."
Ellis Burger in Gent is not a pleasant place because of the people who was supposed to be kindly! Think twice before sitting there !!!!
"Went there for dinner Saturday evening. Took a great while for us to order drinks and looking at the menu. All service was very slow, both food and drinks.The fries were very soggy, not crispy at all. Tasted like fries from McDonald's. Which we didn't want.They were out of some dishes that we ordered, but they never informed us about that. They just brought in other random dishes that we didn't want. Positive thing is that we didn't have to pay for the replaced dishes. But one of us is super allergic to seafood and one of the replaced dishes was with shrimps and they never told us what the replaced dish was! That could be dangerous. "
it is a pizza with lots of weird stuff on it..The decor tries to be something it is not (it is just cheap plywood... nobody 'designed' it)Behind the restaurant is an equally overpriced chicken place... owned by the same woman. Just so you know... this woman is so cheap she shares 1 payment terminal for both restaurants... that is what you will get on your plates :-)
"Sat down at 8pm, waiter paid no attention to our table.At 8:50pm we had to ask for bread, and around 9:10pm we got our entrée. Nine of the smallest oysters I've ever seen. Waiter was rude, has no respect for his profession, never even asked if we enjoyed our meals or not. The LOBSTER was overcooked, tiny portions of food. Not worth the money at all! Not only are ever returning, I will actively discouraged people from going there. Every guest I interact with at the hotel I work, will know what a terrible place it is to eat."
"Went there lunchtime, bar had just a few chaps inside chatting, couldn't see the barman. After a few minutes polite waiting my husband asked nicely could we get a beer. One of the men chatting went behind the bar and said ""he was having a conversation"". Pah! Could've carried on AND served beer, or perhaps he couldn't multi-task. How rude, awful customer service. Drank our beers outside and determined to make sure not to visit this place again. There are plenty of better places in Gent."
Charging tourists double prices...  7 euro for a chimay beer that will cost you on the most expensive terrace about 4 euro no explanation at all!
"The view is great, the looks are great. One does go for lunch for the nice food though and this has been absolutely poor for two times in a row. The first time my fish was really overcooked and tasted like leather. I don't know how you can do this. The second time, one month later, the food was nothing better. My colleagues hardly dared to eat his portion. I won't return.Prices are first class however, service are more pub style and the food... Well you've read it."
I was looking forward to trying out this place. But as soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by the rudest waitress I have ever come across. Two tables available for 2 each we were 3 adults one child so we were told to wait we inform the waitress that we would sit separately... she decided to cracked the rudest not so funny joke loud enough for everyone to hear. “ hey it’s 4 of you what are you going to sit on his lap?” She pointed at me and my brother-in -law. After that we decided to go to cafe Rosario. 
Near to the hotel we came across this curry house but we were disappointed because the table edge was not cleaned properly so I got stains on my shirt. We ordered two dishes which tasted exactly same and I can understand why because they don’t have time to cook fresh being so busy. But then who is paying the price ???? We as guests who are eating there .. the glass of wine was less than half filled but charged full . It’s a trap for tourists and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone
horrible f***ing Service. never expirenced something like that. you have to wait hours before you're seated and the waiters are very apathetic.
"We had an impression, that owner doesn't like english speaking ppl. He acted like a crazy man, sent us out, said they are closed (on Saturday evening!) and was quite rude while our friend asked about beers on the menu. People like this spoil the whole impression from beautiful Gent. Avoid this place."
"Mediocre cuisine.Outdated interior.Parking space close to garbage area.
Waiting times between courses exceeding 60 minutes.
Overpriced dishes. Very clumsy service.
Never again...I would definitely advise against going there."
"We were in a group of 7 last night. It was a nice welcoming restaurant staff friendly. We were in 7 so some ordered Flemish stew, another grilled gambas, steak and pastaThe Flemish stew was Perfect and people were pleased with it. Pasta is pasta so not much to talk about the gambas were average but wrong for main. It's more like a starter. The steak was not good and my friend was unable to finish it was tasteless and not enjoyable. So my rating are really low. I know. But that is per staff at the end. A girl with a real attitude that we could not believe. She made faces and noises and was so reactive to the situation. We were in 7 people and they were 4 cards to use. First she refused to accept she wanted to charge only one card. This was super strange as we been to 5 different restaurant in Gent over the weekend and did not had this problem before. The the waitress went to talk to someone and then agreed to accept the 5 cards. But you should be there to see the attitude of her. Really posses of and making things seems.so difficult and a very reactive lady who has no idea about been friendly no matter the circumstances. Just because she did not want to charge 4 different cards. I see no deal. We are a group of friends who travel around the world very often and have not yet experienced it ever before. So if you go there make sure you are paying with one card or cash and only order the Flemish stew.  "
"The food is fine. The service is something totally different and awful. I've been snubbed in better restaurants in better towns, but nowhere and never like here. I spent two hour + sitting at the bar trying to catch the eye of the woman who seemed to be the Manager, but she managed to avoid eye contact all night. The entire wait staff was only marginally better. But I think they would have let me sit there for 2 or 3 or 4 hours. Amazing in the most negative way. P.S. I am very easy going, and I've never written a negative review before. We were served one round of drinks after about 20 minutes. And they deigned to give us a second drink with dinner (about 2 hours after we sat down)."
"We've already make reservation for dinner, but unfortunately when we arrive the waitress wasn't very friendly and a little rude for my taste. Then we got our place upstairs and it was really FULL. And I see nowhere of good ventilation especially during corona time. So we decided to leave the restaurant and not to have dinner there. Oh, the rude waitress also didn't ask us about our covid certificate. Which is weird because it's kinda mandatory in horeca Belgium."
"I have been tto Domestica during my business trip in Gent. Place is nice, even if waiters are too sophisticated. Starter tooks about 25 minutes to arrive and Entrecote about 1:30 minutes.I asked explanation, they gave me the Bill. I was happy to wnet out."
Unfortunately we didn’t read the reviews on here and wished we had . Lovely location and ok food but the service is poor . Small menu not much choice . Rude staff member . Long waits to get served and to order . Then when we asked for desert menu we were told that he didn’t have the staff in the kitchen to make any deserts . But they were still accepting orders from locals for deserts after we had been told this So we could only conclude that the owner didn’t want us as foreigners any longer in the restaurant and we were discriminated agonist for some reason . Pity as it’s a lovely location . Would not recommend.
The place looks really nice but unfortunately the food is tasteless and overpriced. Worst Indian restaurant I've every tried. You have much better options in Gent for authentic Indian/Pakistani food at half the price (Punjab Tandoori (Pakistani food) and Indian Curry house).
"I asked for a coffee and croissant with butter and marmalade alas I got a coffee and cold croissant with no butter and plum jam so I said this wasn’t what I asked for, do you have marmalade and was immediately told they were not taking it off the bill! Not sorry sir we don’t have any.. or let me take it back or anything polite so I won’t be coming here again"
Thw worst pork ribs we’ve ever had. Very low quality of meat and extras (only baked potato was good).
"Okay it looks affordable but if time is money, this is for sure the most expensive restaurant in Ghent. We ordered 4 pizzas and never saw them. The waitress tried to avoid our questions and finally told us our meals were the next to come, in an empty restaurant, after 45 minutes! 15 minutes later still nothing, so we left, empty stomachs.I still can't figure out what they were doing in the kitchen, sadly not food !"
Today I went there with my family and friends. And we experience worsts food of our life. Service was very bad. And the food was totally bad. All the curry was smiling bad. And staters was not freshly made. Highly recommended not to go there to waste your money.
"The restaurant informed us that there would be vegetarian/vegan food. Unfortunately, this was not the case. You can order some vegetables, but it is cooked in a pan in which meat is cooked too, without refreshing the water in-between. You have to pay upfront, so we had paid before we could see that there was no food for us to eat."
A very rude arrogant waiter who claims he is the manager will be the downfall of this totally unimpressive restaurant. We were four people and I wanted to share a pasta with my husband as i wasn't very hungry. He then claims each of us need to have a plate each. He says he has lots of people who like to eat in his place although it was obviously half empty. Then when one of us were asking for recommendations he arrogantly said 'I don't know. It's up to you!' Certainly this type of restaurant doesn't deserve business. 
"I have never received a worst treatment in my life. Once I sat down I said I only speak english, when I saw how the waitress looked at me the first thing I wanted to do is to go out from the restaurant a nightmare until I paid and left the place. The food was not helping, very poor without any taste. Anybody could do a better rice at home."
"Coming from London where the high streets curry shops offers consistently good value tasty curries this restaurant is poor value by comparison. The food has too much oil and not tasty. Unless youare craving for a curry after too much local Belgium cuisine , avoid or set your expectations accordingly or you will be disappointed. We paid 50 gbp for a main dish, two veg, a nan , a beer and a water. Left half the food as there were too much ghee."
"This place looked very nice, especially the patio. There weren't any seats on the patio for my husband, young daughter and I so we sat inside. And waited and waited. No one would serve us. We waited 25 minutes and despite making eye contact with the waitress several times, she for some reason would not serve us. We left, which we have never actually done before. Shocking."
"bad quality, food arrived cold , cheatings prices, burned falafel and Kibbe we asked waitress to change it but they didn't refund it or change it. Dishes were not fresh. we had a terrible experience"
"It was awful. We went there to eat special Iranian food but they bring some other foods that we didn’t order it! Certainly it was first and last time that we go there. The price is high for nothing. We were really unpleased with this restaurant. They said the chef was sick, if it’s true why you didn’t close for respect to the people? It was really really bad memory that I ever had."
"Terrible service. We chose one pizza for 2 people and the waiter said that is impossible, because was too much work for only one pizza! And look: the pizza was very big. Never, never goes there!"
Very impolite waitress. Food is average and drinks were served on glasses (coca cola or water). Bill of handwriting. Absolutely not recommended.
"Teeeeeeeerrible service, it can ruin your day just spending 5 minutes here. I travel a lot and this waitresses here are the worst I had ever meet."
"the grub has nothing to do with Italian spaghetti... overcooked pasta, too much sauce, too much cheese...  Staff is cocky and lazy. Wine is terrible. 
Pasta for people who don't know their pasta."
"Terrible service terrible food.
Nothing good about this place. Don't  recommend it at all.
I called for the manager and they refuse to call him. 
Never was so bad treated in my live."
"We were there 1 day ago. The location is awesome but the staff are terrible. We were waiting one hour (yes, 1 hore) for our beers... Never ever will we come. There are better places close to this ""restaurant""."
"this restaurant is constantly full and i would doubt ever with a repeat client, which may explain the poor level of food quality. i had a chateaubriand which chewed like a shoe and french fries that oozed warm oil from their half-cooked insides. there are so many other options in ghent that this tourist trap should be skipped"
"Ok let me explain, so we enter the restaurant, 3-4 waiters pass us and say nothing, so we just sat down to a free table. After waiting 20-30 minutes someone noticed us finally and came over asking what would we like to order. I had to ask for the menu otherwise how am I supposed to know? Another 10 minutes, here comes ONE menu for TWO people. Another 20 minutes and I get the chance to order. We were waiting half an hour for hour drinks, one hour for the starter and another hour for the main course. While waiting I have seen several tables who arrived after us already eating when we didn't even get the starters!!!!!! You guys better close this place and sell it to a professional!"
"The owner of this restaurant probably thinks he can offer a gastronomic experience to its naive guests by combining a snotty service with an overpriced menu. Unfortunately, Gent is not St Germain des Pres.The starter (Pata negra ham) was ruined by an over-sugary abricot sauce killing the taste of the ham. The meat was well cooked but tasteless accompagnied by boring side dish.If you can, avoid the claustrophobic courtyard of Domestica and go to smaller restaurants offering similar choices at half the price."
"Trying to recreate Italian pizza, but the crust is much too thin and much too crunchy. Little in the way of toppings, except the burrata cheese, which is cold and therefore the pizza is also cold. They encourage large groups with their long tables, but only allow you to pay with a card (no cash), and only one card per group. Even with just five of us, this was chaotic, especially as the bill was close to €200. Prices are high. Desserts were fine, but desperately overpriced. Mocktail was also very good and only a little overpriced. Interior is supposed to be rustic chic I guess, but it just felt like i was sitting in a warehouse of unfinished particle board. Acoustics are terrible. Service isn't much better. The whole place is indicative of what is happening to Ghent right now. Gentrifying itself into oblivion."
"We ordered a few pizzas for us and our kids, and also some water (because it is what they always drink and it can't be expensive by default). But whoerever can show us in the bill that your water costs 9 euro???! Guys, it is incredible. I don't mind about money, I care about your attitude to your guests. If you cheat with hidden prices, how could I trust that your food is safe for me?! I would never recommend this place to anybody, because of this crazy attitude."
"First time, we came 10 minutes before closing time (14h) and we weren't allow (almost angry) to eat anymore. Ok, I understand so after negotiating I could take away my pizza, which was ok, topping was not so royal but taste was good. Nevertheless I gave it a seccond chance next time and came on time, but was send away because I didn't made a reservation. I don't know if that's the Italian way, but the way they put us at the door was just very rude. It seems they don't mind having less customers and care even less about losing potential clients. They don't care at all. No matter how good the food might be, I'll NEVER return again. After reading the other people's revieuws here, seems I'm not the only one...."
"Avoid the place after 8PM. Staff is only interested in closing the restaurant (although one hour left to the official closing time).Three tables with customers trying to eat and enjoy the evening. That was impossible because of the staff swapping the floor (dust all over the place), the loud noises (only covered by louder music) coming from the kitchen where the huge pans were washed, the staff shouting at each other and trying to get rid of us asap.Horrible experience."
"We ordered food for some of us, but not all, and they served food that we didn't order, making us pay it. They made us feel miserable after trying to explain it to them."
"The setting and food were really nice but the service was below every expectation. There was no time to listen to what we wanted to order. At first the order was incorrect and a wrong dish was brought to the table. It was suggested to ask the kitchen to replace however while making the impression that would require quite some effort. The wine we ordered wasn’t available anymore which can happen, but we got another wine put at the table without asking us if that was alright. Again, when ordering dessert the order wasn’t completely taken. While asking a question the waitress already left and only listened half. During the whole evening everything seemed to be in a rush, a lot of effort, painful… not one smile. Never coming back here again."
"The good:One of the waitresses was quite friendly.The white house wine was nice.The bad:The food was disgusting.Such places should be forbidden by law. I don't even believe you can create such terrible dishes by accident. Somebody in this kitchen must purposefully torture and defile ingredients. This is a disgrace to the beautiful city of Aalst.My wife had a wok with rice, curry and chicken. Or at least that was the idea, but somebody forgot to tell the cook that, in order to mix ingredients together in a bowl, you actually need to use a spoon or similar to stir occasionally. So the approximate half spoon full of artificial taste enhancer was concentrated on the bottom right of the plate. To top it all off, the cook managed to overcook the rice so thoroughly that any texture whatsoever had disappeared.The piece of chicken breast was correctly cooked, albeit without any spices.I myself was going for one their summer salad dishes, which was supposed to be fresh goat cheese in a mantle of bacon, on a bed of green salad. What I got was a small plate two leaves of green salad, upon which was placed a piece of toast bread. On that toast was a piece of goat cheese and a couple slices of bacon cut in julienne, as well as a couple of slices of dried out apple. All of which, clearly had just suffered unspeakable agony in a microwave!!!I couldn't believe me eyes or taste buds.I want to be clear that I do not feel that the ingredients were spoiled. I believe that anybody with the slightest feeling of pride could whip together a couple of edible dishes, that could be sold for money. And since this happened during Saturday lunch time, it could be that their usual cook was off work and some unfortunately incompetent kitchen help had to do actual cooking instead of cleaning floors. On the other hand, if this were the case, it should not be the customer's problem.Just don't go there, and you'll be fine!"
"Poor and overpriced food & drinks. The older woman (manager or owner) was really unfriendly. They were behaving like they had to protect the staff from Covid but when you had to pay, they didn’t care anymore. There are way better places to have breakfast."
"We had made a reservation here but at the last moment, some friends canceled. We immediately apologized and notified the staff when we arrived. In 15 minutes, the reserved places were taken up by other people, but nonetheless, the owner thought it necessary to come and scold us in a very impolite way. During the evening, it became clear that the owner is just always impolite and boorish.The staff did not look very busy (they were idling around the counter most of the time), but still it took a very long time to get them to notice that we wanted to order.The tapas plate we ordered as an appetizer was really nice and good value, but after that it went downhill: we had to wait more than an hour for our main course and when it arrived, we were all disappointed because of the bad quality: the chicken in all dishes was really dry and not very tasty. If you market yourself as a chicken restaurant, this is a big failure.In general, prices are very high. Even for a touristy place, the prices for Orval are exuberant.The only thing this place has going it for it are the good location (very near the center) and the nice interior, but that's about it."
"Tonight we booked this restaurant. Some of our friends had been and said the owners were odd and the food variable but it was worth a try. At 19.00 we got a call that a close relative had died and so we called the restaurant (as evidenced by our phone records) and cancelled the booking - we obviously weren't in the mood. At 23.45 our home phone rang and the restaurant called, a man was abusive and yelled at us for not honoring our booking. We explained we had but said he should not be calling us at this time anyway. He called back two more times before midnight and was abusive again - my wife is.still in tears. He sounded drunk but nevertheless we will never go there again - we never book and then don't inform a restaurant if we can't make it but we have never experienced anything like this - Gent has hundreds of good restaurants with great service - never give your number to this restaurant and only book if you are sure that even you face a breavement you will be abused for a timely cancellation.I am disgusted!"
The Pizza is not good! Tuna pizza was soggy Very expensive They charged us for a glass of water 2.50€
"We are giving 1 star for the service as the staff are friendly. But the food was not good - nothing was fresh, everything covered in heavy sauce, it didn't taste like anything was being made fresh in the kitchen. And it was really overpriced for the quality of the food."
"Imagine this: After a hard day of work you want to take an international senior vice president out in the scenic city of Ghent, only to notice that this restaurant simply tells you that there aren't any salads anymore. Pretty tough if you're looking for vegetarian food. Place looked empty as well. We're not coming back anymore. What a wonderful location tough..."
"I visited during the Ghent festival in July 2011. The food was quite nice but the service and the waiting time was possibly the worst I've ever experienced. The staff were very rude and when we complained about the waiting time they asked us to just pay up and leave, simple as that. Utterly terrible service. NOT recommended."
"We just thought that we'd try out this place since we've heard so much about it from our friends years ago.Its a really bad and poor place for the quality of food being serve here in OZZO.The dim sums aren't fresh at all and its certainly from the deep freeze, cos' I had the same ones at another restaurant in St. Niklaas. Can't the cooks make fresh dim sums? What a shame!The Ebi Fry are too from the deep freeze, cos' its still stone cold in the middle.A friend of ours had the Tom-Ka-Kaai and its taste nothing like the real Tom-Ma-Kaai.I think its made from a ready-made paste simply available from the supermarket shelves.Terrible soup!Then there's the main course the Sushi combination. The ones we had, you can taste that the rice isn't all that cook cos' we can feel the raw hard under cook rice amongst the rolls. The nigiri rice falls apart when you try to dip it in the soy sauce, and too no taste to it at all. There was a few pieces with crab and you can taste that it isn't fresh at all, smells a bit to Ammoniak.All in all, a very disappointing night for us. Deep freeze food, ready made soup and a slow slow wait for the sushi.My friends told us that it use to be very good sometime ago.What happened? New Chef? New management? ?????Try to avoid this venue people."
"The restaurant is nice, shame about the service. The waiters are very rude and the menu is really poor choice ............ you are obliged to choose what they decide for yourself ....."
I must be honest and say that we didn't eat in this restaurant. We are frequent visitors to Ghent and normally stay in a hotel not far from this restaurant. Having walked in on a rainy April Thursday evening we felt that the welcome was as miserable as the weather outside and by far the worst we had ever experienced in Ghent. Rude staff who insisted you sit at an uncomfortable table in an almost empty restaurant and not particularly clean. We certainly wont be back again!
"We tried to have lunch on the terrace with our 2 children, to be told rather rudely there are no children's menus at all and children's portions of the main menu weren't possible. As the dishes are expensive (a sandwich is €12,50) we were already disappointed but decided to stay as the terrace was nice. I then asked which salad I could have as I am gluten intollerant, I got a shrug and was told that all the salads would have gluten (never heard such a thing before) and nothing could be changed.We then decided to pay for the drinks and leave, but were told ""we had to have food"". Only when I pointed out he told me he wasn't able to feed me, he reluctantly agreed to hand us the bill. Avoid!"
"We made a reservation in the evening.We sit down and him gave me a French menu card, ask for dutch or english. they did not have . my french is not so good and my wive can not talk or read french. They onlu have steak and some fish dishes. they do not serve french fries or any kind of sauce.Sorry i do not why some people talk that this restaurant is very good. ah yes at the end of the menu card they write some english. good food is slow cooking. this make me cancel the drinks and go to other restaurant"
Food was ok but a little expensive for the quality. The service was a bit long and the manager was very rude maybe because we are not locals?
"Arrived to a place that looked nice and got a very friendly welcome but then the disappointment started. Starter: a sharing platter of meats and cheeses. The meats were nice, the cheeses were either very bland or excessively truffle infused. Trying too hard.Main Attempt 1: I ordered a pasta dish that I had eaten on several occasions when spending time in Italy. And it was disgusting, again whatever cheese they had used in it had an overpowering off taste and just rendered it inedible. I asked them to change it, which I almost never do... and got a very condescending response and begrudging acceptance. Main Attempt 2: I got a simple ragu dish this time. The same as my partner had ordered originally as I was taking no chances. Clearly rushed so the pasta was hard. Wine choice by the glass was limited and only ok for the price. Overall no way I would return. "
"Very unpleasant people Works here. I came with my family to have a coffee.It seems they are making a favour to serve you. Empty room. Me, wife and son. Table has only two chairs I wanted to have another chair for us mal tô seat and they SHOUTED we were ""troubelling the whole place"".We immeadetely left the place.Never again will come here."
"The food was quite good, but the service was terrible. The guestwife was not at all friendly and forced us to take the dessert, although we did not want it. So we didn’t touch it."
"On arrival they had not found our reservation although set by Facebook with a response in the hour, we had to move to another restaurant, the owner was not that polite I will not advise anyone to go there as it is not run professionally."
We didn’t book in advance and got there at six o’clock straight to catch a table (on Monday evening!) -even though the restaurant was completely empty the staff told us we cannot dine here without a reservation. Found them very unwilling and rather rude.
I cannot imagine anybody coming back again to this place. And that is exactly how the owner treats you. Just don't go.
"As a party of four on a fairly quiet evening, we were hoping for an enjoyable meal at this very attractive location. Unfortunately the service was terribly slow and indifferent, dishes were forgotten and we ended up eating our courses at different times. No-one seemed to care and my attempt to complain was met with arrogant rudeness; we left this restaurant very unhappy and disappointed. The food, when it arrived, was good, if a little cold, but the service was atrocious."
"poor quality, no english menu, asked still water received a 2 dl glass of tap water.. asked a bottle received a 1,5 plastic bottle! do I have to take a shower? menu says grilled calamari.. ordered: they were calamari rings. Tried the Dame Blanche as dessert: melted ice cream in a plate covered with chocolate cream.. not so attractive as a 'Dame' ! not for me."
"I ordered a ham cheese sandwich but I got a chicken salad baguette with egg instead. Service was nothing but nice, nobody asked if everything was fine. I asked TWICE for a receipt, he told me I woud have got it 'later' (but I payed in advance so it made no sense). Server /owner was a bit rude to me but he was nice to other customers. Is it because I spoke English not French? Really a pity for a place in the city centre."
"I wanted just to have a nice big salad. I could not have one as it was considered an entree. I would have ordered a salad that was more expensive than many of the pizza's...but it was impossible. As my 2 kids were under the age of 10, they could share a pizza, otherwise they would have had to have one each also. Yes the pizza's are very good....seems the pasta also.....but to not serve a salad unless you take a main (at lunchtime) is ridiculous. And we really tried to get her to change her mind, but it was impossible. With service like that, no matter how good the food is, i wont be going back."
"Was bitterly cold and thought this place looked quaint from the outside. Ordered drinks and then sat down. Table was very dirty and sticky, moved to another and it was the same coils not see any clean tables. Went to use the toilet and just did a u-turn, absolutely filthy and the smell was terrible. Left without finishing our drinks. The member of staff was more interested in his mobile phone than the few customers he had."
"Yesterday night, in a hot but bustling Ghent, we went to the restaurant ""The Acht Zaligheden"" situated in Oudburg 4.The moment we entered, I felt this was not going to be our best idea. Staff was busy enjoying themselves, customers at that hour of the day (19:00h) were a mere nuisance.We ordered baked eels. The lady did not ask what we wanted to eat with our eels (bread or french fries). Eventually the food arrived, served in small pots on a small rectangular plate - all very awkward if you want to eat like normally educated people.The eels were GREASY, tasteless and probably had been deep frozen.Come to think of it, the best part of the meal was the lemon we got with it.Although Ghent has a sheer limitless number of good restaurants (for all tastes and wallets), we definitely chose the wrong one."
"For the second time on a visit to Gent we were rudely turned away because we didn't made reservations. We sent an email in advance where they didn't feel like replying. Only reservations that are any use are telephone ones. Hello 1980....
Screw this place...."
"Visited for the first time and the service was terrible ..Waited 40 minutes for my lasaña to be served ..The food was discusting I would not recomend this place for eating only for drinks..
I will never come back there.."
"Please don't go there. Waiting 2 hours to get the food. When we got it it was wrong. Didn't want to wait 2 more hours. Checking out the machine did not accept Mastercard or Visa. The mananager asked us to go to the bank, one of us had to stay ""otherwise he could flee""It was a terrible experience and the manager was a little ""Hitler"""
"Coffee tastes like they haven replaced the grains for a week.Sandwiches all have the same dull taste. The tomatoes remind me of the tomatoes they served in primary school: no structure, no taste and very watery.Panos is a business that does not create quality, is expensive and aims for the less critical people as a public. All the other places in the station are better value (the coke in the vending machines is even cheaper that at Panos)"
"The building is an old dirty church, not taken care of properly, there's traces of mould on the walls and it has an overall dark an dirty feel.The food came very slowly, when you know in advance that you will have a party of 120 guests, make sure to arrange enough personnel to handle this.The amuse-bouche was good, but from there on it only went downwards. The starter was a canneloni with crab, and was all it was, no flavour, not seasonned. The main dish was some fish, which was probably cooked in water, it was like a sponge, no flavour at all, this was really terrible, a shame to put something like this on a plate. The parsley was not cleaned, everything was crunchy because of the sand on the plate. Dessert was chocolate cake, simply bought frozen. There was some whipped cream too, but it was not fresh either.Absolute horror!I would like to make a strong point to potential guests: please go somewhere else! Really!"
"Owner is unfriendly, his clothes are dirty and he smells like sour milk.For some reason to add cream on the pizza.Service is very poor. Probably one of the worst restaurants in Gent. Only clients are poor tourists who like me did not check the comments before."
"The fries were good but the service was terrible the lady seemed upset if you asked anything.
In conclusion: Nothing special."
"Way overpriced, unqualified personnel, average food, not organised.
Long waiting times, clumsy waiters, little class, little style.
Very nice location but not worth the money unless you want to be ripped off."
You have to check out how terrible this place is! Really! The location is nice but the staff... This type of inefficiency was of bureaucratic government proportions. Waaw really i mean... Just waaw
"We went there around 9pm because we want to feel how Ghent by dark is. We took our 1,5 years old with us because I don't want to leave him in the hotel with a babysitter,and the waiter didn't seem happy with that. He asked us to move to another table and then when my husband told him that we just want to have a drink he asked us to leave. Then his superior said it was OK, just stay.. have a drink. But still we were a bit shocked with how the waiter was so we just left."
"rice had no taste, sweet sour sauce was water with some color and weird soap taste.
different meat meals weird taste to not good cooked or anything.. 3-4 different menu's we tried where more then poor... VERY dissapointed!!"
"We picked this restaurant cause it seemed nice but the waiter keeping addressing us in flemish even though we asked him to talk to us in english should have given it away. Horrible service, 45 minutes for a cheese croquette and a pizza ham! Eventually after waiting fir 45 minutes a waitress came to our table with 2 different pizzas which turned out to be for a couple at the table next to us that was just arrived. We left."
"The host is unmannered, the food that we got wasn't good. Yeah we asked for some food and didn't get it, we wanted to ask where it was and the host told us to wait and wait and wait and now we're here with hunger and in agony. Don't bother coming, if you do come don't pay."
Had lunch here with five friends we started off with drinks then decided to eat. Because we wanted food we moved to a larger table This confused and offended the staff. It then took two hours to have one course and two drinks even though the restaurant was quiet. We ordered a third drink and were charged for it but not served it. Food was adequate but nothing special. The service was really disappointing and not at all what I expect in Belgium.
"We went in a group of 12 people. They said with every menue we take we get french fries as side dish. At the end for 12 people they gave us just 2 bowls of side dishes. The main dish was ok but comparing to the price the quantity was bare minimum. So, after this 2 bowls of french fries finished we asked for more and also we asked for ketchup and bread. They charged for every extra bowl of french fries and even the ketchup and bread under the pretext of extra. This is unexpected and we vow not to return to this crappy restaurant anymore."
"The couple in front said they'd been waiting for over half an hour to get 2 simple pittas, and I'm afraid that should've been my cue to walk out before ordering.The man behind the counter kept his earphones in, didn't once smile to his customers, then simply walked out in the middle of preparations. His assistent came in after smoking his cigarette and then continued making the food. When I asked to change my choice of sauce (to be added only at the end, of course), he said that was impossible. You ask for this sauce, you get this sauce. The final result was extremely greasy and the vegetables were off. Look, there are countless places in Ghent where you can enjoy a very good pitta, so you can easily skip this one."
"my B&B hostess gave the place a rave. Unfortunately, i could not get service. It did not seem like a very busy night, there were even empty tables outside, but they seemed short on help, and the woman at the bar who had the airs of a manager/owner told me she was ""too busy"" to serve me. She also inquired me if I was from a nearby hostel (I was not). This is a totally bizarre situation that could not have possibly emerged in the US. You can always put one person at the bar, for cryin outloud. So No De Lieve for me."
"Can’t believe that other reviews rated this restaurant so highly! It cannot be the same restaurant!!We ordered two paellas, which was not what we got. Three pieces of tempura fish and one ring of squid, some yellow rice containing dried shrivelled peas, a few butter beans from a tin, and salad covered in mayonnaise despite telling them that my husband had an egg allergy, all served up on a chipped plate. The wine ordered was served in a tiny glass, and because I asked for ice with it there was very little wine served. The service was surly and when an adjoining table complained that their food was frozen, all the owner did was argue loudly with them until they left. The saving grace was the location, but the rattan chairs were broken and falling apart. I cannot believe that this restaurant is still in business!!!! It can only exist for the tourists as locals would never use it"
"We came to this restaurant and not finding anywhere else for a place. The first waiter that we spoke to, was very rude, but instead of taking the que, we decided to sit anyway. The waiters were very very slow and completely unprofessional. Granted, our visit was on a Saturday of a long weekend, but that doesn't justufy it. We ordered bruschetas for appetizer, and requested without anchovies. They brought it with anchoyies, took it back, and obviously just removed them since the bruschetas still tasted like that afterwards. The 3 pizzas were at best mediocre. Definately not recommended. Stay away! "
My shoes were stained with rat droppings after leaving this place. My water glass was stained with lipstick and had bits of food floating in it. The veal was so undercooked it started eating the salad. I threw up in my mouth a little when they brought me my food. I wouldn't come back here on a dare.
Was one of the most terrible experiences I had as a customer in Belgium.We order food which was medioquer the service was terrible was an arrogant old lady that did not even told me where the bathroom was. When we order our fish there was no price on the menu and we ask the old arrogant lady what was the price and she said 18 euros. When the bill came they decide to change us an extra 2 euros per dish. We called the lady and ask her why was the dish being charged an extra 2 euros she said that was the price. We told her to call the manager and she told in our face we are not welcome and we are lying and manager was also not very friendly and did not seem to care.
Never again. Had to wait 45 min for a tunasteak that arrived cold. After making a remark about it the waiter turned unfriendly.. Worst experience ever.
"The food is disaster. Expected nice meal - came expecially to Ghent on the way to Dunkirk, after reading all these nice reviews. Total disappointment: food not good and made me feeling bad, service quite nice, although not Italian style at all. Don’t really understand all theses good reviews."
"Actually, it's the 5th GOK Brasserie & Restauraut that served bad. Bad manner staff let us wait for too long to get our order. When asking for menu, he put over my head."
"Entering the restaurant I went to the bar to ask whether it was possible to buy a take away pizza within 15 minutes. First of all i was inspected litterally from toe to head by the woman serving in the restaurant. After kindly asking my question, I was publicly scolded by the chef in itilian that I needed a McDonnalds . Needless to say I don't like this place at all! Never will go there again."
"VERY RUDE OWNERSHIP, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER:Yesterday we were having a drink with 8 friends outside at this place. We all ordered a drink and wanted to have a good time since our finals had just ended. Eventually it got colder and so we decided to go inside this cafe to continue our conversations. All of us ordered a second drink except for me. Therefore the owner and his wife (who were taking orders) got upset and started to FORCE me to order a second drink. I didn’t want to since i had already drunk something outside and i was driving and also I didn’t really want to drink anything else. They got VERY RUDE and ARROGANT and continued forcing me so eventually I ordered a second drink since i just wanted to have a good time with my friends. They can be sure, we will never never go there again!! No customer service whatsoever!!"
"Ordered 1 buffet for myself and a main dish for my husband & drinks as my husband wanted to eat something special from the menu. We were shocked when the owner already told us at the very beginning that I can start from the buffet & my husband has to wait as if we are people who intend to eat for free. The owner just assume people are free loaders.Since we were very hungry, I gave only 1 pakora from my plate to my husband & we have the owner coming over to say the buffet is for only for me.We decided to leave as it was humiliating for us & said we will pay for the drinks even though we haven't touch & the buffet (as the owner insisted).At the time of payment, the owner even added the extra main course ordered even though it was not even ready.We said we will pay only for the buffet & drinks as we wanted to leave asap.Very disappointed of the level of unrational rules & poor customer service. On top the main dish we ordered for my husband was even more expensive than the buffet & we were supposed to pay 14 euros to have 1 piece of pakora.Incredible!!!!"
"Apparently, it is not advisable to visit with children. Waiter narocila child screaming. Forced to were to leave the restaurant, for avoiding violence."
We had tapas and some other food and ot was so expensive. The tapas is around 7e per dish and you get one spoonful for 7e! No atmosphere and staff quite unfriendly!
"Contrary to the note on the door, this is not a welcome place for vegetarians. My husband and I visited last night - the menu had scant true veggie options so - being pescatorian- I selected pasta with scampi. The dish was meant to contain bacon but the waiter agreed this would be omitted. When it arrived, there was bacon throughout the dish (I couldn't have picked it out if I wanted to) and the waiter simply didn't care, he was indignant... no offer of another meal, nothing. When pushed to remove the cost from the bill he eventually knocked off 5 euros (of the dish price of 18) to cover the cost of the bacon. He was rude and angry when we took the 18 euros off ourselves, shouting at us that he would have to bear the cost. What a dreadful dreadful experience of what is supposed to be Europe's capital of vegetarianism. "
Honestly never been treated so bad to ask for a drink after waitiing over an hour. Food was crap avoid honestly the service was so bad and they look at you terrible won't be going here again
"This restaurant seems like a tourist trap, and I know cause I live here. The pasta was bland, not much taste, and the staff wasn't friendly and didn't speak dutch."
"You can not dine quietly because there are noises and none of the staff intervenes
Please do something!"
"The service is horrible, they are rude and not friendly. I have never been treated like this before."
"Pure deception. In the end we paid 40 euros/person for some couscous with some pieces of meat, and some glasses of wine.Very Unfriendly service. Always check your bill!!! They will try to make you pay more!!! If you ask for a bottle of wine, they will automatically bring you the most expensive one!!!Worst restaurant experience in years!"
My boyfriend reserved a table for 4 people and they cancelled 1 hour and 30min in advance! 2 of the people were on their way from Antwerp when we got the call. They told us there was “a mix up” and that they could only seat 2 people. Ridiculous!
"I have visited in summer last year. It was a very busy day and therefore I thought the food wasn’t very tasty due to that. I decided to give it another chance and came here for an anniversary dinner. I ended up disappointed once more. I ordered a knuckle of ham but instead I got a knuckle of fat. I really struggled to get any piece of meat out of it. When the waiter asked was everything okay, I complained the meat wasn’t really my taste and all he replied was ‘it’s just the way it is’. I thought that it was a rude answer towards a customer. We asked for the bill and left straight away. Never coming back again. "
"We sat for 20 mins and never got greeted or helped. Staff walked by us and didn’t even acknowledge. Food didn’t look great either. Charging 12€ for cheese, packaged yogurt and bread? No thanks."
"I have been today to this place to have lunch with my colleague. I was waiting for my turn to order. When I was waiting I put my hand on the glass of the counter. At that moment I got a slap on my hand, she warned me very arrogantly saying that it is not hygienic. The same person put my piece of quiche on the buttom place where all the fat leaks and burns without a plate under it..... Isn't that more unhygienic???? Not coming here again......"
"My wife and I stumbled upon this restaurant by complete coincidence and thought it would be a great place to eat. The meal included insults from the manager from start to finish. For starters, he brought a beer to the table that was not even on the menu and then insulted my wife because of the beer she ordered. We ordered the cheese fondue thinking we’d have a variety of food items to dip in it, but to our disappointment the only real things served that should’ve been dipped in it were bread and frites (fries), kind of plain if you ask me. The price shown on the cheese fondue was simply 24.90 euro as opposed to the two multi course options in the front of the menu which specified a price followed by p.p (per person). When it came time to pay the bill he charged us double what the menu said and when I asked him why he said that’s what the price is and acted like I was a fool for questioning it. To make matters worse, when he was punching in the charge amount on the card reader, he flipped the first two numbers and would’ve charged us 22 euro more than the amount already being questioned. Had we seen the numerous 1 star reviews prior to considering it for dinner, we would have most definitely passed on dining. I have never been so disrespected at a restaurant in all my life."
"The service was really bad, our order was wrong, 3 of the 6 dishes we ordered never served, the delay of our food was over an hour."
"I was visiting Ghent today and caught up with a friend and decided to have a drink on the terrace of this café. Staff was rude and awefully unfriendly, totally ignored us. When asking for the check they kept us waiting while cleaning tables and looking the other side. Most appaling service ever!"
"Ordered a pizza with burrata and parma ham, and paid for it dearly. Received a pizza with supermarket level STANDARD MOZZARELLA and cooked ham.
Pizzaiolo freaked out when realising i was italian. AVOID"
"The service was totally terrible and extreme slow. We were a group of seven but were set in a small table in the corner right the front door like they put us on the box, even the restaurant was not full. We needed to wait not only 5 minutes for table cleaning but also 40 minutes for the meal. Chicken was not special al all and the sauces were not enough. We will definitely never come back! "
"Avoid “restaurant “ Neptune at all costs! We were refused service in a very rude and aggressive manner by the proprietor because I asked if it would be possible to have my steak cooked in oil instead of butter for medical reasons. Was told if I was going to be difficult that I could just take my kid, buggy and the rest of my sh*t and go somewhere else. He was loud, mean and in our faces. He then chased us and started shouting and accused my husband of pushing him after he himself stumbled and bumped into my husband.. we are locals... if he is willing to treat locals who could be return customers like filth I can’t begin to think how he would be to tourists who won’t be coming back anyway.... do yourself a favour and stay far away from this place."
Went with a group of friend and had set menu with wine. Came to at least 70 euros per head. Wine was average and limited quantity. Not one of us liked the ham hock. Staff were not particularly friendly. Won't be going back
"Very poor Turkish food, not sure if Russian salad and tuna mayo are Turkish, pretty sure white bread isn’t- no flat bread … cannot recommend."
"Probably the fastest meal I had in a restaurant with my family.Manager was not friendly at allDishes were not fresh, the fattoush was most probably in its dressing since 2 days and the meat was dry and cold.The Hummus was horribleI'm very familiar with the Lebanese cuisine and I do love it; It is a disgrace to all the levant food loversBy the way, the prices are very high for the quality of food and the restaurant overall ambiance"
"In the not so good, uncomfortable beds, dubious stains on linen, peeling wallpaper, stench of previous guest kind of way. If self punishment is your thing, this is not a bad place to start. Otherwise, avoid."
"After 45 minutes they came to take our orders, limiting us to max 4 dishes. We only took a main course, resulting in a wait time of an other hour. Several orders were taken incorrectly. Food was ok but overpriced. When adressing the waiter on the long times they don't even take responsibility for it and try to shift blame. Worst place I've ever been."
"I was attracted to this restaurant because it styled itself as a ""vegetarian restaurant"" and it has a terrace by the river. I sat on the terrace, which was pleasant, hence the one star. The food was dire. It is not a vegetarian restaurant - it serves meat and fish - but it does have vegetarian options. I ordered a bell pepper stuffed with tofu and cheese. The plate I was served was a jumble of everything and anything - the phrase dog's dinner comes to mind. The half pepper was there, along with rice decorated with seaweed; pasta with a soy dressing; saute potato with sour cream dressing; broccoli with satay sauce; tomato cooked and raw; roasted aubergine; a mash of potato and carrot; shredded cabbage ..... and maybe more; I lost count. This melange was not cheap €21.50. The restaurant was not at all busy (two other tables occupied) and the reason is clear. I came out onto Kraanlei and enviously saw people eating some nice looking dishes. If you want a riverside seat, go to the tourist traps on Graslei ... or buy some frites and eat them sitting on the wall. You'll be better off that way. By the way, I take no pleasure in writing bad reviews, but sometimes there is no honest alternative."
"We had a nice evening but that had all to do with the company and very little with Patyntje.We only had starters and a main course. The starters: an selection of sushi (with supermarket wasabi) and artichoke. The sushi was ok, the artichoke was plain and even tough at some points. The main courses: cannelloni with ricotta and broccoli, and stingray. Cannelloni: good, but exactly what you would expect, no extra touch, no special flavor, etc. Stingray: Without a doubt the most plain taste of stingray I ever had (overcooked). Sad because it can be a very good product. The service was slow to say the least. The only moment we were served in a quick manner was when we got in. The rest of the evening was waiting. The staff (which is abundantly there) does not see work. They walk by, looking at your table, and just walk on. The maître belongs on a farm instead of a restaurant. Glasses were dropped as if it was Russian new year. The shattered glass landed under and on the tables and was only cleaned after minutes (since the maître wasn't planning on cleaning his own mess).Even when we wanted to pay my beard grew a couple of mm's. After getting the bill, I heard them say: ""That table is ready to pay"". And it took another 10 minutes before we could (after we specifically asked for it). Long story short, I won't be coming back. PS: Prices are inflated"
We order delivery sushi at Yammi Yammi and we were not satisfied at all. For the same price you can get better sushi somewhere else in Ghent. The fish did not look and taste fresh. I will not order here anymore.
Waitresses wore masks incorrectly. Food basic and Belgian interpretation of Italian food. Expensive for what it was.
"I can't believe the poor organisation of this place. One single girl for a full restaurant to wait on? She had to turn down numerous people who didn't have a reservation, even with tables clearing out later, and sitting there dirty because there simply wasn't time to clean them. Two more people here (one in the kitchen and one in the restaurant) would have doubled the revenue for that evening, and we had time to observe this, believe me!Because of the severely undermanned staff, we had to wait almost a full hour for our burgers. Our beers were empty for a while by then, and the poor girl just didn't have time to remedy this.Even worse, when the burger finally DID arrive, it was so overcooked it resembled the sole of my shoes: almost black and just as tough to chew. One of the worst burgers I ever had, including McDonalds!I have nothing but the greatest respect for the waitress, who didn't stand still for a single minute and was friendly to everyone. The cook, however, destroyed our burgers (we all agreed on that) and the organisation was a mess.It's not all bad, however, as the onion rings were delicious and the matching beers were well chosen. Not by them though, from what I saw in the menu...This is the third time I've had a bad experience here, so it's not as if I didn't give this a third chance. I won't be coming back again, and will recommend all my friends and family to give this a wide berth as well, sorry."
Their service is the worst I had in the whole Belgium. They charged me in my credit card and refused to gave me my voucher. I ended paying double for a lousy meal.
"It looks like we were the latest in a long line of tourists to fall prey to being ripped off here! Yes it is quirky, but I was charged 6 euros for a beer that I had paid 4 - 4.5 elsewhere. Fine if it was upmarket, but it was really shabby & worse that most people's garden sheds. Quirky is ok, if there is a price list, but you don't expect to get ripped off to that extent. It was obvious when I asked to pay, that he come up with the price off the top of his head.He must have done ok that day, as I got off lightly compared to others.....judging by some of the reviews. Luckily my partner did not have a drink, so only got ripped off once. We only popped in for a quick drink while we were waiting for a restaurant in Oudburg to open. We had spotted this place down a side street when we walked through Oudburg & it looked interesting.When we mentioned this bar to the waiter in the restaurant, he was very disappointed. He said that this person had a different price for tourists & reflects badly on the way tourists are treated in the city.Avoid unless you don't mind paying over the odds for drinks!!"
Should have read reviews.  You should too. Most horrible experience in Gent. Waiters are incompetent and so is chefs. The food swimming in pool of grease I had to fight for them to take back.  Avoid avoid.
"Horrible experience, the food was expensive and has no taste. The waitress made a mistake in my order and didn't want to change. Decoration is nice however."
"The food is clearly microwaved from a frozen state and the beers are the most expensive ones in Gent. Yes, they have 300. There's four other bars within a five minute walk from here that have more. And it won't be these brands you find everywhere, and it won't cost you 6 euro for a 25 cl glass."
"Quirky - yes.
It was only when he charged us 18 euros for 1 tall beer that we realised we had fallen into the basic tourist trap of not checking prices before ordering. Avoid the cobwebs and keep going to a bar by the canal."
"This is not a first time I’m in Belgium and it was the most horrible experience ever. I could not taste any meat at all .. it was to oily and very ting they used looked horrible. Customer service was really bad , when I told what I think , they said everyone likes it and you should like it ..."
"Although it was freezing outside, we were not welcome to sit inside at 4pm if we didn't order a full course meal. Just a drink and a waffle wasn't enough for the Stern, unfriendly woman. She ""kindly"" referred us to the outdoor seating, full of smoking people in the freezing cold. No thanks"
"Don't go there. New chef doesn't know what real food is. Arrogant service and 7.5 euro for a small bottle of water...  A real shame, this used to be a nice place"
"After our bad experience in another restaurant (no waiters, no service, no food) that same evening we tried this one. A lot of tables on the outside, so we took one and sat down. We already noticed that there were some empty tables although there were customers sitting at it. Same situation here:it wasn't a self-service restaurant but apparently they had forgotten to hire or call the waiters. This must be karma. We are not very difficult, believe me, but what can I say? Ok, it wasn't the most ideal moment to visit a restaurant because the streets were very crowded and there were a lot of things going on, but hey, if they can handle their business at the city's festival they can handle it anytime, no? No waiter, no order, no review score."
"On first glance this looks like a attractive place in a fabulous 18th century buidling. In reality this restaurant is a pinnacle of mediocrity. If you like bland, greasy food and uniterested service, devoid of anything the Italian culinary tradition stands for, this is the place for you. 'Quite possibly the worst overcooked penne Arrabiata I ever had.' and 'This pizza is topped with sadness.' sums up the experience. Luckily we were able to laugh it of, unlike the unfortunate older couple next to us, who had their romantic night out ruined by an argument about how bad the food was. If you would happen to uniwittingly step into this place, remember you are still free to leave before ordering, as my girlfriend rightfully suggested. She is clearly the smarter one."
"went with a groupon ticket to take the 2 dishes menu. the cafe looked as a cool not happy place. the service was zero: shortly said : the meat was served cold, after our remarks, taken away and put in the microwave. in the meantime the frites became cold, and were taken away when the dishes were brought again.So, the meat was cold again when the frites were brought...the salads came out of a packet - the sauces also we think. luckily we only ordered 1 groupon and do not have to go there a second time"
"Arrived at 9pm on Sunday evening , asked the waitress if they serve tartar steak , the answer : yes. We sat on the terrace for 15 minutes and nobody even came to us to ask what we are doing there . I went to the bar to complain , the girl who initially told us about the steak tartar said she’d never seen us . Another staff member said: ok, we can see you now , what do you want . We just left .I believe their food can be good but the service and attitude desire to be much better "
"Great decoration and nice concept, but horrible, unfriendly service by a woman who clearly has a lot of frustrations. We we're told to order a new drink after only 15 minutes."
"Ordered filet pur, it was overcooked, gray and very dry. Huge disappointment compared to a previous visit."
"Visited this restaurant yesterday night, restaurant not very busy,food was ok, nothing too good and nothing terribly bad with the exception of the fries that were sloppy, not fresh and seemed reheated, in a country where there are fantastic potatoes this was a disappointment, overall to expensive for the food quality. The reason why I have 1 start was because of the poor service. We are travelling since more than a week and have been to several restaurants where the menu is in local language only and there has been always someone very happy to guide us through the menu, not this time! One of the waiters(the barman) came to our table, when I asked if they had a menu in English he said no, so I kindly asked his help to understand what was on the menu. With the most annoyed face he told us he was not going to translate the whole menu for us (the menu is not that big). In the kids menu was written hamburger and nuggets, so he pointed at that and said this is the same as in English. However, this was the only two words we could understand out of the whole menu and not what we wanted to eat. He rudely went away and we were left with Google translator that unfortunately did not work for us as well. We are staying 3 days around the same place and will not definately came back to this place, it was undoubtedly the most arrogant and rude waiter we ever came across."
"I visited the Pakhuis with an associate last summer. The hostess was firm and abrupt, and my associate was put off but I encouraged him to sit and have a beer while they readied our table, which they said would be an hour. They brought us menus and asked us to order even though they told us we could not be served on the terrace, odd we thought. About 45 minutes later they ushered us to a table with food already set, as you can imagine this is uncommon and led to another awkward moment. My associate's steak was the toughest piece of meat ever served to me or anyone I know dining. The entire steak was like a running shoe sole, one could not chew it long enought to get it in a form to swallow. He did not want to create more awkwardness so he refused to send it back. This year I stopped by for a reality check; was it really that bad I wondered. No hostess on the terrace. I went inside to the hostess station there but no one came after 10 minutes. I went to the bar but was ignored. Until a server told me to leave the bar, to go to the terrace and take a seat and someone would be with me soon. I waited 20 minutes more and left. I have never met more arrogant people."
"I ordered the vegetarian wok with quorn. They served me pasta with cream and a tiny bit of vegetables (like 1 tablespoon). Almost cold. No quorn. It didn't taste good at all.When I told the waiter that this was not what I asked for, he kept me waiting for a very long time. Finally the ""boss"" came to listen to the problem. He took away my plate. I ordered back my money, but he said that there was nothing to do about it. This place clearly is a tourist trap. I strongly recommend you go eat somewhere else where they have better customer service, and better food."
"Despite the acceptable flavors, we might consider the menu as average amuse gueules, but definitely not as respectable courses. With a bit of luck we had a total of 4 potentially good “tasters” for the rate of a full high-end menu. Even taken the supplementary dish, we left the table hungry and very disappointed! "
"Normally, I am an easygoing person in my relation with food, but this time it was even non-tolerable for me. Very plain and not tasty steak, smelly fries and a terrible pepper sauce shocked me. I couldn’t chew anything, and it took only 25 minutes to leave the restaurant. Please think twice to visit here. P.s. the lady was friendly enough"
"How did restaurant ever get a Michelin mention? We chose this restaurant for a nice evening meal after our law conference. Even though we made our reservation months ago, the restaurant was totally unprepared. They had one waiter to service the upstairs area that seated probably 60 people. Because we had a larger group, our choices for dinner was fish or beef. When you asked what type of fish the answer was “white”. After taking our order, he came back and told us that 4 fish orders had to be changed to beef. GreatThere were a few who ordered the steak well done. He diligently wrote it down, then brought it out an hour later medium rare. When asked to send it back to the kitchen to be cooked more, he gave us a sneer if disgust. Tremendous customer service. When the food was finally brought to us, everything was cold. My steak was 50% gristle. The steak and fries were cold. By that time we had been at the restaurant for 3 hours and just wanted to eat. Maybe if you are a regular at this restaurant, they might treat you better. Ps-the toilets were dirty and the sinks were clogged up and overflowing. Really disgusting. "
"We were disappointed. Location is nice, but the dishes themselves were not worth the price that was charged. Furthermore, we did not really get what was shown on the menu. For example, as starter I asked for the smoked salmon, but got a mixture of various smoked fish, including a bit of smoked salmon. And the salad that was served to both of us was frankly below par.And it was not cheap!Last but not least, there was a penetrating cellar/toilet smell in the restaurant."
"We sat down in the outdoor area along the river and ordered two beers and a pizza. Neither came, so we had to leave after 20 minutes. We feel the waiter decided he did not want our business since we were only ordering a pizza to share on a Saturday evening when other guests might spend more. It was very disappointing that they treat customers this way."
I am never coming back here! Overhyped. The steak was so undercooked it started eating the salad. The whole place was just dirty. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'DON'T EAT HERE!'
"My experience in Gent was wonderful until I visited this place. The old lady was rude with me and my family. We performed our order and my five year old cousin would not drink or eat, so she told that you sit only if you eat. My cousin and my sister had to wait outside!When I tried to pay our €35 check with a €50 bill, she told that she is no bank to exchange €50! It is unbelievable! We had to pay with foreign card!Shame on awful people like that!"
"We had to send the main course back to the kitchen, because the starters didn't arrived yet. After the starters the main dishes came back after a long waiting and the ordered filet puur were dry, cold and complete overdone.This was my first time that I had to send food back to the kitchen.This was really a very bad performance. For the many times I came here, this was the last ."
"Too many things on the menu look like crap, smell like crap, and taste like crap. I asked for my steak medium-well, but it was frozen in the center. I found a dead cockroach on the floor of my booth. They can survive a nuclear explosion, but the entree was too much for them. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'BEWARE OF DOG (FOOD)!'"
"They call themselves ""Thai Fusion"". It is not what I think of as Thai Fusion. It was regular Thai and not very good at that. They ""require"" reservations which we did not know even thought at 5:00 in the evening there was only 2 couples sitting downstairs. Without reservations they put you upstairs. When we walked in she said ""reservation""? When I said no she turned and yelled something in Thai to upstairs and left us. Someone came from upstairs to get us and take us up. Let me tell you these stairs on not for faint of heart. They are wooden, winding and less than 8"" in width and literally go straight up. Very scary. Once seated we waited and waited. No one came to take our order. Another couple, locals we believe came in and were seated next to us. We told her we were ready to order. We ordered. Ten minutes later she came to the table next to us and took their order which was exactly the same 2 dishes we ordered. Exactly. Our food was still not out yet. Ah here comes our food. Nope. It went to the locals sitting next to us. After waiting another 10 minutes I asked my husband to check and see if we were forgotten as the table seated after us had already received theirs. He came back and said ""she said it is almost ready"". Really? We ordered before them and still no food. We waited another 20 minutes and finally the order came. We ordered curry chicken but were not allowed to add any spicy to it. You get it as it comes. Flavorless. The portion was tiny, not really enough for 2 adults. I do give them credit for it being hot. The other dish we ordered was a veggies stir fry with tofu. Again, absolutely no flavor and tiny portions. Absolutely would never recommend this place. The hostess was rude and nasty. Very high prices for such a little amount of food"
"Waited 45 minutes with an overpriced water for a simple plain sandwich, and I still did not get it. No explanation why it took so long, nothing to eat or nibble while you wait. The waiters have no idea what they're doing: wrong drink orders, stumbling around the terrace with soup that no one had ordered, etc. I eventually left, so couldn't tell how the sandwiches taste, but what I saw from others eating: they're really not large at all, although very pricey..."
I arrived early while the restaurant was literally empty. They refused to seat me because I was traveling solo. The two people who walked in right behind me without a reservation were seated immediately with no problem.
"Made reservation at 19:00, ordered at 19:05...Food served at 20:00. Finished at 20:05. (The 'horse' style portion..., 14€, about half from a regular portion elsewhere...)Extremely noisy, student restaurant atmosphere, very incomfortable sittings...Place to avoid"
"The hostess/boss did not want to serve 4 people at 2 tables, instead we had to sit at a big table in the back. We politely declined this as we wanted to have a nice street view. As reaction she refused to serve us. Very immature and rude hostess. We decided to leave."
"Avoid this place, it might look inviting but the service is appalling, the staff are rude and unpleasant. We arrived for a table at 8pm, we were told to return at 9 - so we booked a table for 9. When we came back at 9 we were totally ignored, we stood in the doorway, all the staff pretended that we didn't exist despite us trying to attract their attention. We then waited for 20 minutes, 8 other people were seated in front of us despite arriving after us. We were made to look fools, ignored and humiliated by the horrendous staff.There are hundreds of nice places in Gent, you don't need to suffer the terrible service here."
"Going out to eat is not only about food, but rather the entire experience. My wife and came into the restaurant after making a reservation, sat outside, and a few minutes later it started raining. we asked the waiter if we could sit inside but refused because he had other clients coming, surprisingly, a Belgian couple next to us was allowed to have a table inside who came in to ask after us. We asked to sit and wait only from inside but he still refused and we ended up walking in the rain.Maybe it was because I was black? but that was absolutely not friendly."
"I had high hopes for this restaurant but was let down. I don't normally write reviews but this experience 'inspired' me to sign up on tripadvisor. We opted for the take outboxes and won't be back. Service was poor with unhelpful, disinterested staff. Food was expensive at 8euros for a take outbox which was for hot food only (salad items weren't included).I wouldn't have minded the cost if the food was good but it was a big disappointment. It was oily,greasy and salty - none of the tasty, wholesome veggie food I was expecting. I dont like to waste food or money but we had a few mouthfuls and couldn't finish the rest. Ghent has many veggie options but I wouldn't recommend this place."
"I had the misfortune to eat here this evening , my wife and I went on the recommendations on trip adviser expecting great flavours and good service , but if your looking for this try else where.Bland noddle dishes and chicken noodle soup like dish water, no flavour ! No aroma just told to spoon in chilli sauce that was not available ....All told many people have eaten here as your see in reviews but it was not quick , and if there's a problem you are still expected to pay even if you've sent it back within minutes. How they made number two I have no idea!....If your looking for spice/ aromatic flavours don't bother ....a real shame ......"
"Dirty, smelly, disaster.  What a shame that they are on this beautiful spot.
English spoken... but ONLY English..
Dus... Gentenaars, blijf hier maar weg, deze ""pub"" staat in de verkeerde stad..."
"The atmosphere looked quit nice, sitting next to the water. The food was not bad, but as a guest it looks you mean nothing to the staff. We have been waiting for almost one hour for some salads. After we asked our waiter how long it would take to serve the salads he answered ""salads always take a lot of time"". Twenty minutes later I told the waiter we wanted the check and to pay. The waiter run inside and the salads were there. The only thing he said was ""he could not help"". After that I orderd another coke and after eating my salad (20 min. later) I still did not get it. I asked for the check again and he came back with my coke. I told him I did not want it any more and prefered the check. At last, I went inside to pay and told another staff member I was not content. Our waiter came to me and told me that I was not correct about times and that the did his best. Terrible service, I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Stay away!"
"Gotta say the service is quite bad, they are extremely busy with deliveroo and takeaway to actually pay any attention to the clients inside the place, the noodle soups are genuinely tasteless its noodles in hot water with some veggies and whatever you got.I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone."
"It was like being in Fawlty Towers but without the humour. The manager made his young barmaid cry by barking orders at her while he fatly sat at the bar downing tiny glasses of beer. Meanwhile he loudly agreed with his waiter's complaints about our group (that we weren't ordering enough food - despite being 10 people all but two of whom ate full meals in an otherwise largely empty restaurant), presumably he thought we couldn't speak Dutch, possibly he just didn't care. The waiter went on to spend the whole evening aggressively trying to persuade us to order drinks we didn't want and openly mocked those who didn't give in. As a resident of Gent I was embarrassed that in an otherwise spectacularly friendly city we have perhaps the least friendly people in Belgium. The food wasn't as bad as the service but the evening was already ruined. Avoid this place or risk getting totally the wrong idea about Gent!!"
"This was by far the worst persian food experience I ever had.

Low quality (tests not original) food with high price. 

Very aggressive and rude waiters and slow service."
"We had a sit in the restaurant and then were waiting for about 45 min hoping that someone can come to take our orders. I had to go to the bar to order beers, and despite saying to the waiter we will be eating he continued ignoring us and dared say that we should have shouted. We simply leftA very bad experience caused by an unpleasant and/or incompetent staff. Shame on you"
"I have never witnessed such bad customer service in my life. Me and my friend arrived around 6:30pm and there were two tables available. Unfortunately, there were two couples who arrived just before us and were seated at the tables. The waitress, a blonde woman with glasses, rudely told us we would have to wait 30 minutes for a table and quickly walked away. We then noticed a couple leaving so lingered to see if the table was available for us. When she returned, she told us ‘what are you doing still here? I already told you three times, it is a 30 minute wait’ in a very disrespectful manner. I have never witnessed such awful customer service in my life, she also made the other waitress feel very uncomfortable. Definitely not Sicilian hospitality - after such a lovely day out we felt quite angry about how we were treated. If you want Italian food and good service, I suggest you visit ‘nonna stella’ just up the street instead."
Nothing was tasty! Dishes are very sad!   Very low quality. Old style restaurant with annoying live music.
"Nice breakfast and a very friendly service, but then you see that the eggs they serve are cage eggs and not even free range:( !!! .
For a place with vegetarian cusomers they serve animal abuse!!!
Not recommended!!!"
"We had the misfortune to eat here last week, whilst visiting Ghent for the Davis Cup. Following 2 great meals in PakHuis and Belga Queen restaurants, we were recommended to come to Godot. The food was inedible, even the Chateaubriand was as tough as old boots,and the staff were not interested in our complaints. In fact, the manager became extremely argumentative when we complained, and claimed that we must be wrong because his meat supplier was the best in town. Do yourself a favour and avoid this place."
bad cuisine. too expensive for crap food.
"I ordered the one vegetarian dish on the menu and was surprised when I got halfway through to find pieces of chicken. It had taken so long to arrive I decided not to get it replaced and to leave it. Naturally, I wasn't keen on paying for it though. Unfortunately, the owners went straight from the disagreement about the bill stage to stealing my wallet and camera off the table and calling the police. My wallet had disappeared so chasing it into the restaurant, the owner tried to manhandle me out of the restaurant, almost physically abusing me. None of this was necessary and all very distressing. The owners need to consider their behaviour and vegetarians need to avoid. "
you have bring you won water..?asked for water they do not serve tap water.... think they from Bangladesh...Explains al lot..
"I came there around 15:00 on Sunday. The place was fairly busy, but I got a table inside. After 20 minutes of waiting, the waitress told me that she won't be able to serve me as all the waitresses are extremely busy (and they truly were) and also it'll take long time to get my meal cooked. I immediately left the place heading to another nearby restaurant.They definitely have to hire more staff to keep up with a high demand (on weekends) and avoid receiving negative reviews."
"Waiting 45 min at a table that still had to be cleaned from previous guests. Finally could order drinks that arrived 15 min later. After being waiting 1 hour and 20 minutes, meals were served. The 34€ steak was overcooked and they appologized.They served new plates of steaks, unfortunately we were not that hungry anymore. 2 waiters for an overbooked restaurant is not done. 50€ per person ( only 3 plates,3 beers & 1 bottle of modest wine included) with this service.....shame on you!"
"20 min before we could order, 1h waiting for the food. They had to ask us several times what food we had ordered. Still they messed-up one of the plates, mistaking cheese with fish Krokets. 

Not coming back."
I went Gent for a business trip and went there for dinner on the night I got there. All the waitresses were quite rude to begin with. It took them forever to get an order and refused to give me wifi password. I waited for my food for an hour and gave up and walked out. I will never go again
"The pizza was probably taken out of freezer and ovened. It was still cold inside and burned. The service was negligent and very slow, it took them half an hour to serve us a drink. Taking into account their average bill, it did not worth it at all. As an end, they did accept only cash. Terrible place!"
"My family and I were incredibly excited to eat here on our one-day trip to Ghent. Unfortunately, even though we made a reservation which was CONFIRMED, the restaurant was closed with no warning. We then had no other options available, and it really left a bad mark on our day. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
Having been to many Indian restaurants across the world this is the worst ever! The food was not only bland but it so over cooked it was awful. And to make the experience worse the food took so long to come to the table it was ridiculous some of the other guest left as they waited for so long. We didn't even get the right order! I would strongly recommend giving this place a swerve!!
"My friends and me ordered some beers and the owner of Rock Circus screamed us saying that we go there only to have sex with Belgian people because we’re Spanish. It was degrading and racism.
I absolutely recommend you not to visit that place."
"No tap water, they announced dishes with fries aside and then charged extra for every single fries ! They even charged for mayonese and ketchup !
The best part is that they don't warn you that everything is extra...
Never ever go there."
"We picked this restaurant without reading the reviews in advance. What a mistake!The food was bland, very average and very expensive.It was six of us. We ordered some bread while we waited for our courses. The first 4 rolls in the basket were fine, the last two were as hard as fossils. The waiter dismissively said ‘ they must have been from yesterday’ and said he would bring fresh ones. He never did. Firstly, they were not from the day before, more like 2-3 days old and secondly, how can you even conceive of serving stale bread when you charge astronomical amounts for a couple of croquettes and some overcooked pasta?! Avoid!"
"I am very confused, went to this restaurant as it was the best rated on Tripadviser.I am sorry but this is a poor excuse for a curry house.I had the butter chicken which tasted so bland & was tough. It looks like they didn't marinade the chicken but just put the sauce on top, terrible.No choice of rice, just plain white bland rice, bland is the word for this place.Not sure how this gets top rating for Indian food as it's the worst one I have had."
"Due to a regrettable miscommunication about a group reservation we experienced a very icy reception. Hard to get an agreement about sitting outside on the terrasse. A prime example of how not to receive guests. 
The pancakes and coffee were perfect."
"Had a set-menu dinner there with a group of friends. The aperitif and accompanying finger-food was terrible, we didn't even drink it, as it was too acid tasting and the bites were dried-out. The dinner itself was below average with no taste in the food at all. We paid 55-euro for what was like a day-course of max 15 euro value, way overcharged! And although the servants did their best, the owner was unfriendly and even aggressive. I will never go back to this place, it is faded glory!"
its a very basic pub. not too bad i guess if you just want as drink although it is expensive. the staff were extremely rude and arrogant towards us. not somewhere i would recomend to anyone. much nicer places to go in gent.
"Food is fine, but seriously overpriced.Service isn't good, we tried to take the menu incl. wines. After a poor explanation from our hostes we thought these would be included in the price (it says so on the menu!). In the end the wine wasn't included, we had to pay an extra €40 for the housewine! We never even saw the bottle, it was served in a caraf.We confronted the hostess, but she said that wine is never included in the menu. Then why didn't she tell us when we ordered and explicitly asked? And why does it say 'incl. wine' on the menu?Really disappointing. We won't be eating here again."
"Because of a misunderstanding the guy has been so rude that ruined our night! Please if you want to enjoy a beer with some friends go somewhere else, such rudeness cannot be forgiven."
"We really had the weirdest experience at this place and it was so out of character to the rest of this lovely city and our dining experiences in Gent and around the world. We were enjoying a lovely adult family evening and the blond waitress just really put a damper on our enjoyment. She was full of rules that I have never had before and none of it made sense. It felt that she was making rules up as we went along but then we read the reviews and realised this is a normal activity there. Basically, there is some management issue and even though the food was tasty I would not return for the hassle and the level of uncomfortable feeling she gave us. Eating out is meant to be a relaxing and enjoyable experience and she needs to recognise that people don’t go out to eat to be treated so rudely."
"I usually don't give out 1 star reviews, but from a tourist's point of view this place is not very accommodating. We were looking forward to eat here after our host's recommendations. But unfortunately we were met with quite the hostility when we asked for a brief overview of the menu. We asked nicely but were turned away very swiftly without any attempt to win our business or any other options.I'm guessing locals are treated differently, which is a shame because I've never seen a restaurant that turns away clientele."
"Not busy Saturday afternoon, went there with two couples and two preschoolers. The initial wait interminable, so I went up to get some menus, but was told to wait for the waiter. He decided to set up a table for no guests, rather than come with the menus. Then, he dropped them on the table. Our daughter wanted soup. We saw another table eating it but it wasn't on the menu. When the waiter came back, I asked,and he said we could only get the soup if we ordered the meal of the day soup and bouillabaisse which read 14.95 Euros. But the waiter said,it was 17.95 Euros because it was the weekend. But it is marked 14.95? No accommodation for soup for a kid or the price gouge from the waiter. We decided to leave. On exit I spoke to the owners or managers who were on their high horse on the soup and especially the inflated price. That's the way it is, it's always been like that. Let alone make an apology. To add a cherry on top of the experience. I came back to visit our friends and found a credit card outside on the ground, telling them if somebody calls, it would be at the police station. It took a good minute for them to tell me it was an employee, but in the end as they showed me proof, I was told by one of the owners to take it to the police. I left it with the other owner who said he would call. All in all a big ""huh??"" for this place. Friends said service continued to be appalling and frustrating but the meal was good, though. They won't be going back either."
"We were treated very badly by the manager (I suppose) of the restaurant. It was probably a very busy day for him but he took all his stress and rage at us, forcing us to leave the restaurant. First he got upset because one of our friends went to the toilet just when he had decided to take our order, although we knew what our friend wanted the manager wouldn´t listen to us and said he would not take the order if we were not complete...in a very angry mood. And then when we ordered the pizza to another waiter the manager came back almost screaming at us saying that we couldn´t share the pizzas. He could have said everything in a more polite way and I wouldn´t be writing this review, but he completely ruined my day. Also, the pizza was super expensive."
"Came here for a nice veggie soup. If you just order a tomato soup you'd expect it only to be a tomato soup. Was so grossed out to find meatballs in there! Also found out later that they use chicken stock in the soups. Was so unimpressed. As a vegan in the #1 vegetarian capital of Europe, I expected to just be informed that there was meat in there!!!! I went to get my money back and was refused it. Basically the lady just said bad luck and moved onto the next customer. So horrified. Vegetarian or not - do NOT come to this place. Poor quality, rude service and overpriced for sizes given. Walk 5 minutes and go to Soup'R instead. Amazing options, brilliant service and value for money."
"worst restaurant ever, waited 2hours for a single meal.
i would certainly not recommend this place to even a dog"
"Expensive, a burger costs 13€, is really small, and everything else you pay even extra, salad? pay extra, fries? pay extra,...
Very crowded inside and noisy!
If you want a really good artisanal burger, visit Fabula Rasa"
Title says it Went again to make sure it's not by chance the first time I went and experienced horrendous service. Same again staff not happy to be here. Won't come to yoy won't serve food bla very over priced great presentation great view but that's it STAY AWAY FROM HERE 
"We came across the restaurant as it has a nice terrace in the center, close to the river and we wanted to have a light lunch so we ordered two mozzarella salads which were very poor quality, mozzarella cheap kind not buffala and they didn't even give us bread with it, we had to ask for it. It was supermarket bread. And we had a bottle of water with it which was 8.90 euro - more expensive than in Brussels. Salads were also quite expensive considering the small portions and quality. For a price of one salad there you can get a much nicer meal in another Italian restaurant in Ghent, with fresh products and much higher quality. So a very disappointing experience."
"A major language problem here as my waiter and most staff didn't speak English.I don't think they were Italian either, anyway its the first Italian ive been to and not been offered either Black Pepper,Olive Oil or Parmessan. Go to Dominos and avoid this one."
"The food isn't great, but the service is worse.We went to the Klokkeput today with my mother in law. She is in a wheelchair, she walked with difficulties to the terrace. We asked to sit down at 17:30 for a coffee, they said she needed to walk to the Kerkenhoek (another cafe in the area). At the same time, they let another lady sit down.The reason we went is the restaurant is in a nice place (so we were ready to overlook the bad food)... never again..There are so many better restaurants in the area with better service"
"Ordered a pizza 2 houra ago, still waiting for it... 
We tried calling to know what is going on and they didnt even answer the phone"
"We went there in March 2015. The friendly lady on the phone told us they changed their concept. Now they are specialised in pizza and pasta. Great, we love Italian cuisine.Please ! Don't waste your money on frozen food. The pizzabottom was from Dr Oetker and came right out of the freezer, the topping was fresh (thank god), the dessert: tiramisu came out of a package and was wobbling on my plate. We tasted our diner until the next morning.  The only positive thing about this place is that the staff (not the owners) in the restaurant (not in the kitchen) is really Italian. But this ""restaurant"" is an insult to Italian food."
"The cook and a Spanish woman working there were arguing the whole time and could be heard throughout the entire restaurant, totally unacceptable when trying to enjoy a meal! Also the tenderloin was like chewing on a bike tire. Would not recommend this place to anyone."
"The owner is unpleasant. The food is well below average. Bad tourist trap. Do yourself a favor and do not go. Only if you feel like doing some good for the world and annoying someone, then do enter with a group of five people and order one coke :)"
"Great food, however waited almost an hour to be seated by staff who were obviously on minimum wages."
"Terrible service, they lack in client-oriented approach and negotiation abilities! We recently visited the restaurant and one of our friends changed his mind about his order and asked if he could change it. The waitress told us that it had already been ready to be served, so he said ok, no problem. Then, the manager showed up furiously and treated us very impolite. She even suggested that we leave, if we do not like the service. She misunderstood and she thought that we wanted to change the order due to the late service. Then, I tried to talk to her and explain her why we asked for the order to be changed and that I felt offended by her behavior and she did not even allow me to talk... She kept on yelling at me.... Apart from this isolated incident, the kitchen of the restaurant is not well ventilated, consequently the clothes and hair smell very bad after a visit there. Overall, prices are very high for the quality of food and the late and bad service. I would never go there again!"
"We like fresh sole. Before ordering we asked how the sole would be and we were ensured it would be great. We were hungry and time passed by, had to wait for 45 min! When we were finally served, we were upset, because it was a tiny little sole, which was overdone on top of it! When we expressed our disappointed, the owner reacted in a very arrogant way. The daily price is 29,50, which we are more than happy to pay, for a real nice fresh sole. We were deceived and most of all truly scandalised by the haughty attude of the owner. Will never return."
"Worst stuff and assistance i ever experienced in my whole life . After waiting for around 15 minutes in our table, my friend went to the waitress to order and he got a rude reply from her : 'have you asked if you can enter and sit in our restaurant?'The irony is that no one approached us in our entrance or in our table. Their ignorance was in another level... Not sure if we only faced this attitude, as there were other people around us waiting patiently to order. She also said that we had for over an hour if ee wanted a pizza, because she admitted their kitchen is very small. I can only advise :enter at your own risk... "
"Everything very badly passed from the beginning to the end. First of all, the welcome was cold because I was late. There was a misunderstanding for the schedule with the hotel which had reserved restoring her(it) for me. I arrived at 9 pm. Late apparently for this restaurant. The maximum hour of arrival being 8 pm.Result:I had no choice in the menu, the service was fast to catch up the delay, the white wine was cold, not the choice to take cheese and dessert, no flowers on my table contrary to the others and the very distant service(department). As a result, I did not address the waitress nor even looked during my meal. She did not appreciate of the whole! I was at the same time disappointed and shocked to be to deal like that.I am flat at the end of the meal of this treatment. The waitress at the same time owner not satisfied with the whole said to me that it was of my fault. I did not have to manage late and to be impolite with her. The height. I insisted in the criticism. She raised the voice. She indicated me that the discussion was ended and invited me towards the exit.Inadmissible for a restaurant or saying gastronomic. I also sonder if the fact of being French was not also an additional factor. It's a pity because the cooking was good but wasted by this despicable behavior of a smart restaurant. That is why, I shall not advise(recommend) it and shall not hand it feet. I am going to make a negative advertising on the social networks."
"I was shocked today as we were paying and the waitress told us we weren’t allowed to eat there anymore. Apparently some mother told her i was together with my wife in the toilet. The tolerance is pretty low as i was not in the toilet with my wife but outside waiting for her as she is pregnant and have had a rough pregnancy,it was just normal for me to stay outside if she needed help so she could call me. Good job staff for stereotyping a young married couple that they would have sex in your bathroom just because they are young and so losing a monthly client. Guess you think you have clients enough ? On top at the opening hour the food wasn’t ready and the waiters look at us and handle us as if we are kids or something ?!! Food tasted refried and not fresh and when it is not busy even more."
"Nice location but we ended up not eating. First, we entered and the place was almost empty. But the waitress stopped us from sitting down because we wanted to occupy a table for 4 for the 3 of us (Did they want to squeeze 2 adults and 1 child in a 2-chair table when the place was almost empty???) My husband didn’t really like Italian food but we went there because of our daughter. Anyway, we ordered 2 main dishes, 1 appetizer and 3 drinks. But the waitress (probably owner) said we have to order 3 main dishes. I told her we didn’t want more because we already anticipated that my daughter wouldn’t eat up her pizza. I told her we could leave if she doesn’t want to serve us. She said ok, leave! Horrible service! "
"My wife is a vegetarian and ordered the only vegetarian dish (of 3) which had some protein. Pasta rosette with ricotta cheese and spinach. However, it came in a creme sauce, which was not mentioned in the menu. How disappointing to be unable to get a healthy, nutritious vegetarian meal. The management did not charge for the meal. The waitress was excellent."
"So basically, when you book online, they don’t write it down and when you show up at the agreed time, they unapologetically refuse to seat you!

Just UNACCEPTABLE!"
"We went to Amadeus in hopes for a good meal and pleasant evening. We were SORELY DISAPPOINTED!! The waiter (Yusuf), was one of the rudest waiters we have ever encountered. He waited 15 mins to take our order. AFTER taking our order, another 40 minutes went by. When we asked about our order, and why it was taking so long, he angrily looked at one of our party and said, ""YOU ordered waterzooi. THAT is why it is taking so long!"" He then stormed away. The couple near us and a party behind us had a similar experience. This waiter should not be in a business where he deals with human beings. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!"
"After waiting at least 20 mins to be served the starters were disappointing to say the least, including chunks of salami for a vegetarian! While waiting for the main course we noticed we had been joined by a small furry friend, it was indeed either a small rat or a large mouse!! We duly screamed and tried to attract the attention of some waiters, they were not interested at all and just looked on slightly bemused. By this time the rat/mouse was making itself at home under our table so we got up to leave, it was obvious it was used to running around and feeding. On leaving, the manager asked if everything was okay, when told about the rat/mouse he just asked if we would like to be seated somewhere else!! If you can see rodents running about the floors whilst your eating, what's going on in the kitchens??"
"Unhygienic, low quality and erratic service. There are many decent Turkish in that area."
"Bad cafetaria food. Expensive for what you get. I cook a lot better myself. Don't go to Colmar, rather go to a real restaurant where you can eat a lot better for the same amount of money."
"I was at this restaurant with family earlier today. A young couple with a young child arrived and sat at another table. A couple of minutes later the lady proceeded to order a steak and asked the water if it was cooked in butter; and if yes if it could be cooked in oil instead... Immediately the waiter proceeded to shout loudly: «I am the owner of the restaurant, you’re being difficult take your buggy & s**t and leave... »I couldn’t believe how these people were treated! Minutes later the owner returned and screamed at them on the square in front of us, all other customers and passers by. Having witnessed this, we picked-up our stuff and left not wanting to support a business that threats customers like this..."
We went to the restaurant at 730pm and asked if they accepted credit cards before we decided to dine here. The waiters took a long time to attend to us and when the finally did we ordered eels and stew. We got our food at 930pm after numerous requests for them to expedite since we were hungry and tired. The food was average and pricey and the waiter who brought us our check told us the credit card machine was not working and we had to pay in cash. We were terribly annoyed as we specifically asked before we started dining. He was rude and unapologetic. I do not recommend this restaurant. 
very slow service and the food is not fresh. We had t wait more than one hour for our food. The organisation is very ba. By the way the photo is not the Zwarte Zee.
My shoes were stained with rat droppings after leaving this place. My water glass was stained with lipstick and had bits of food floating in it. The veal was so undercooked it started eating the salad. I threw up in my mouth a little when they brought me my food. I wouldn't come back here on a dare.
"I don't know if they changed the crew or something, but the food quality has got worse day by day! and staff rudeness high and higher degree. It takes forever to get your dish, the staff is unbelievably impolite, and the food seriously are you kidding me! I don't recommend anybody this restaurant. "
"We visited the restaurant with my parents and we were far from satisfied. Service was slow and waitresses were rude. We paid for water and only got a tiny wine glass of it. In the end, there was a problem with the computer(?) and we didn't even get a receipt. Not recommended."
"Nice stew, awful service. Had to ask the waitors for the check five times. Took me half an hour to pay for my food."
"We were there with my boyfriend. I chose the eel in green sauce and I got really sick of it, for several days. Nice service, otherwise."
"We had booked to go somewhere else but this restaurant looked so inviting we were compelled to try it. Big mistake! Overpriced and the food was some of the worst I’d ever tasted. I had shrimp croquettes to start which just tasted like they had been filled with fish paste. My rabbit main was inedible- extremely tough, difficult to eat and smothered with a bizarre sauce that bore no resemblance to the description of ‘Leffe beer’ it was supposed to come with. The accompanying potatoes were equally disgusting and the texture was extremely glutinous. My husband’s mussels (which were also supposed to be in a beer sauce) seemed to be served in what I can only described as a sauce of condensed chicken soup with random pieces of carrot. Neither of my sons would eat their chicken nuggets and having looked at them, I’m not really surprised. The chicken looked nothing like chicken! We asked for tap water but were told that they didn’t offer free water and we’d have to purchase a bottle of mineral water- this was £6.50 for half a litre!! Even having the set menu, our bill was still over £100!!The service was quite hostile and staff were very abrupt- not friendly or helpful. I have to say however- my dessert was lovely. One of the nicest waffles I’ve ever had! Unfortunately, this was not enough to compel me to recommend this restaurant or ever return! AVOID!! "
Walked in and told it would be an hour for a table. Just about to leave abd free table becomes available as people leave. Ordered beers then told no food orders as computer is broken after drinks brought to table. Ask another waitress who brings the menus and asks owe are ready to order... having only just got the menus. Tried to order food and told 10 mins as computer is broken. Waiter another 20 mins to be told the kitchen is now closed as they can not fix the computer. Charged for the drinks we only ordered as we were going to eat and told they can not talk orders writing them on paper as it would work because they wouldn't know which table ordered it... then when we pointed out that we watched them take 2 orders on paper at 2 other tables they informed us they had ordered their food before arriving at the restraunt... and honest ... I'm not lying.. . So having spent an hour in there we had to leave at almost 10pm trying to find a place to eat with a kitchen still open... thanks to all the team for taking a great family day in gent at the market end with fast food from a take away on the street... and to the manager that has no plan in ace for if the computer isn't working... sure you can explain to the owners why your turning their profits out of the door... 
"We visitied this restaurant during lunchtime on a beautifull public holiday. Me and my friend ordered a (quite expensive) filet pur and a rib eye steak. I ordered it ""a point"" (i.e. pink but not raw) and so did my friend, but when it arrived blood still came out when we pressed with my fork on it. We sent it back to the kitchen and it came back dry and ""bien cuit"" i.e. well done. When I told the waitress this is not what I ordered and that I wasn't expecting this for a whopping 29EURO, she offered me to get a new one baked. But because by that time we had been waiting for an hour for our food I said I didn't want to wait any longer. The waitress said she wouldn't put my steak on the bill instead. When the bill came however it was still added to the total amount. After complaining they said that because I ate the steak they had to charge me for it. Pointing out the promise that I wouldn't have to pay for it she said that the cook said it was not his fault, that it was my bad judgement of the steak. They were very inpolite, not forthcoming, they wouldn't admit fault, and were even not prepared to offer me a free coffee instead. We left with a very bad feeling.Having said this, the meat was of good quality, but the portion very small."
"Very late service!!! It's burgers, how difficult can it be!! 45 min and waiting with four hungry kids / typical BELGIUM"
"As somebody said it is a three-time experience, the first, last and the only time I'll go there.In a few words: very nice restaurant outside, hell inside, bad service, dirty, bad food and bad wine.. think I do not need to say anything else only do not go there."
"I brought my 84 year old mother on the boat. She was really excited to sit on the boat overlooking the water. As we were looking for a table a very rude woman, owner/manager likely, asked us to leave the boat because they were going to set the tables for dinner. It was 4:15 in the afternoon. Several people were still ordering drinks and there were just a few tables free. I don't know why she made us leave. She saw the effort we had to make it up the ramp. I guess old people or disabled people are not welcome there. She should post a sign if this is the case!"
"Our experience of this restaurant was not a happy one. A surly waiter showed us to the worst table in the place, half wedged behind a door, and then failed to offer us a menu or ask what we wanted to drink (nor did he explain about the bottle of house wine and how we would be charged per centimetre for drinking from it---I found this out on our return after looking the restaurant up on the internet!). We felt very uncomfortable and left without ordering anything after being ignored for a considerable length of time in which people who had entered the restaurant after us were served first. The decor was lovely, but we felt we had stumbled into an anti-British zone. Very distressing!"
"When we arrived at 13:15 the restaurant was empty. The owner did not speak Dutch in a Dutch-speaking city. We asked him for recommendations and he answered that it was not possible. The soup of the daily menu was in a half-full bowl (and the bowl was small). The wok was full of sauce and too heavy. All in all, the service and food were poor (not to mention the place itself; very outdated)."
"One of the best locations on the  Ghent historic waterfront. Unfortunately the food is only mediocre,  the service is very poor, the w/c is filthy.
If you choose to dine here enjoy the view, but don't expect much more."
"Asked for a gin-based cocktail. It was made from a pre-mixed bottle labelled ""Sling"" and something unidentifiable hidden beneath the bar. I watched and waited in vain for the bar-tender to put some actual gin in from an actual bottle labelled ""Gin"". Bland alcohol-free fruit drink cost 13euro."
"Our family came here for dinner, and my daughter was trying to find something to order to avoid her dairy allergy. Our waiter responded to her meek request with disdain and contempt, in word,tone and expression. My worst dining experience in all of my 50 years."
It was shocking. Staff blowing and picking their nose and coughing all over the food with not a anti bacterial or hand washing regime in place. All in view of the clients. We could not bare to eat there so as the food arrived we offered to pay and leave. We couldn't leave until we were verbally abused by the staff however the owner wife was very very nice! Shame the rest of the staff degrade all her hard work.
"Waited along time to get served with almost no one there. No drink order first and the cook came over and unhelpfully stood there while we tried to figure out the menu. We ordered a pizza for 2 of us and he said it was only for one, so we were compelled to order another entre. When the pizza came it way to much for my wife and would have been fine for the 2 of us, so half our meal ended up as unfortunate food waste and more expense. My wife ordered a glass of water and a tiny bottle of water was served for 2.50 Euro. At the end of the meal, since we were with another couple, we asked to pay seperate and the same guy just dismissed the request and handed us the entire bill for us to figure out. Oh yes, and the pizza was burnt. Not sure how they are still in business."
"We ended in this place a few weeks ago and I can say just one thing: avoid it. Low quality tapas for a way-too-much-high price. With all the nice places that the city offers, do not stop at this one."
"Normally lunch in the Hema is value for money. But when I came there I saw they were only selling hamburgers, pasta, things like that. The nasi I wanted to order was not available so I chose chicken saté.... Only after the chicken was ready the person who was preparing the meals told me there was no saté sauce available. The chicken came with fries... only fries, no vegetables. I found it a poor meal for 7,50 euros...For the rest: service is slow and you have to fight for your place. Lots of people take a table for four to sit there alone."
"Excellent meal for the ones who love  waiting as dessert.
1:30 before being served. Just a little too long!
Meal was excellent but way too long waiting time before able to enjoy it."
"Though the service is good, the food was below expectations. Used to dine there but the same dishes that were once great are very disappointing. Even after complaining about it the ""chef"" stood by his dish where the chicken and the meatballs were though and seemed to be old re-heated. The mashed potatoes were dry with lack of any flavor whatsoever, others in the group were not excited either.On the other hand service was good and the restaurant is well kept and clean."
"We tried buffet with 4 other friends every food was not fresh and was very worst food experience in belgium ever. No response of waiter and the mango lassi I ordered ,only the essence of mango was there and it was very sweet"
"As it seems like a nice cosy restaurant, the disappointments follow quickly after being seated! After 20 minutes without being offered a drink, we had to ask the waiter to see the menu card! So far no problem, mistakes happen, but after ordering our food an seeing other tables being served before us while being seated after us, we complained! Finally after more than an hour after ordering we received the dishes, to find the meat overcooked, the vegetables non fresh and a very poor service! Conclusion: Avoid!! "
"I lunched here with important company and I shall never return. The hostess was extremely charming. There are too many ‘scampi and gamba-dishes’ (mostly tasteless prawns) on the menu. Scampi in garlic, scampi’s (sic) diabolique (both as a starter and on the fish menu), gamba’s with tartar-sauce (both as a starter and on the fish menu), a scampi salad and a wok with scampi. Of the eight main courses, six are beef-dishes. I can be quick about the food. It’s plain. The wine list is very good and definitely value. What genuinely disturbed me was the fact that our table wasn’t clean. Our glasses stuck to the table. It was as if they were glued to the sticky surface. Please employ a new cleaner asap. And to our horror, we saw something on the wall next to us that can be best described as nose-pickings. I finished my wine and got me coat."
"Queued here for breakfast. No customer care whatsoever. Zero communication. Tables near entrance, with stools, not in use but no explanation offered. Some staff working hard but others visibly doing the minimum. Hence customers, once seated, waiting too long for service. No sign of a manager. I doubt they have heard of 'mystery shopping' but it is about time the managers tried it. "
"We are Ghent locals and used to frequent this place, until yesterday: we were alone with the owner and he made such faul racist remarks, we just left our food untouched and left as quickly as possible. Never again! #stopthehate"
"I was in very high need to go to the toilet and asked at the Delhaize personnel where I could go. They showed me Kruger. I went in there, the woman working there let me wait and wait and after all she said I was not allowed to go as I wasn't a client of the pub. I said I was in high need, if I couldn't go to the toilet I had to do it outside. ""That's forbidden"", she answered. Yes, I know it is forbidden, but what can you do when you really have to go? They force you to do it in your trousers. How humane is that?"
We didnot like this place. Food was average but prices are more than average in Gent. Waitress was like from Soviet Union fishmarket.
"Service is very poor and rude.Food is not special, food quality is poor. Shame for the good Belgium food reputation.The restaurant used to have a good name in Ghent, but unfortunately they do not deserve this anymore. Do not go there, unless you do not mind about food and service and just care to sit at the waterside and spent too much money."
This was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had. Extremely overpriced and rude service. We came with a bigger group and in the end we had to negotiate the price. Extremely unprofessional and the food was both worth the money.
"We went to Panda expecting a tasty veggie dinner, according to Lonely Planet, but were disappointed. I don't know if the kitchen had a bad day, but the food hardly tasted anything. There were almost no people inside and one couple outside on the balcony. The service was kind, but too timid and hesitant (not often that happens) and we had to wait quite a while for the food. It's such a good thing to serve organic food and to keep it sustainable, but I'm sorry to say, but I would not recommend it. "
I am writing this while waiting for our food. Been here for more than 75 minutes and just received some bread. Our wine is finished but no sign of food.
"- the set menu is a rip off
- service: amateurs. Friendly, yes. But No clue what they are doing
- overall overpriced
- loud
- slow
Stay away!"
"Worst place so far after 3 countries in a round trip through Europe. It's a disrespect to customers the kind of service this place has. Food is great, but you'll wait for up to 40 min between dishes, and beg for specialties like shrimp, picanha or lamb. I believed Europeans got used to it, if you notice others comments to analyze. For us, paying almost 30 euros plus drinks and dessert, it's not worth or you need to be in a great mood to challenge your patience. What a pity!"
Nice people but sorry too bad food... i don’t know how long the salad had been in the counter... the falafel did not taste good and the souce tasted old..
Went to restaurant on 12th June not very welcoming think it was short staff manager not welcoming very off handI was with 5 students who also felt the same tried to charge 5 euro for one who was not eating Bill was 145 euro not worth the money as a whole experience Would have been better in the Irish pub Celtic Towers much more friendly with lovely staff and excellent food Had to be said 
"This is truly the worst restaurant we have ever visited in Europe. Firstly, diners are crammed in like cattle which spoils the mood of one's meal. Secondly, the food is at best average. Thirdly, what diners need to be aware of is that the chefs reserve the right to change the meals and ingredients that are specified on the menu, without notice. Without notice! Meaning that as a diner, what ends up on your plate may not be what you ordered. With this in mind, do NOT under any circumstances eat here if you have food intolerances or dietary requirements! I ended up having to pay for two meals because the chef changed what was on the menu ('salmon steak') to floured and battered salmon fillet, seemingly because he felt like it, resulting in me having to send my meal back. Our waitress was evidently embarrassed to work there when we challenged our bill. Lastly, it appeared that the battered salmon fillet I sent back to the kitchen was a few minutes later served to the gentleman sat beside me. AVOID. "
"Visited this place with colleagues. Reserves table not available. Group of students celebrated something with loud voices and singing next to our table and were not tempered by waiters. Sweat from waiters' nose dopped almost in food. Blood spots and other dirt on their ""uniforms"". Waiters did not have time to pay attention. So, long waiting for ordening some water (wine was undrinkable). Food was cold and salty. Finale, I would have preferred vinegar instead of this ""wine"". I advice you: do not go there."
"I have been in this restaurant twice. First time we had an average experience and the food was OK. Second time we were greeted by an unfriendly lady, who later I understood from all other reviews is the owner, that ruined my family's morning. We immediately decided to leave as we were accused of ""lying"" about having a reservation. We had made a mistake thinking we indeed had reserved online a table but it was not for this restaurant, however she still had at least the half of the tables empty. However, once I was accused of lying that was the end for me and my wife. People, do your self a favor and don't risk your precious time going to this restaurant, you can get the same food minus the aggressive owner in other restaurants in Gent!"
The food is below average. The Pizzas are strictly ok. Don't recommend it at all. Staff is also not as warm. So I would say AVOID
"I love Pain Quotidien and love going to the ones in NYC, California, Brussels and Antwerp. But the waitresses at this one, and the manager, have zero customer service. I have been there a few times and am shocked by how they talk to and interact with me. I wish I could go there daily- but it's not worth their terrible attitudes. "
"Don’t worry about the service. It’s not there. The place is overpriced and the waiter was rude and completely ignoring us. We ended up leaving after eating starters, since we were not even asked about what we wanted for mains until 15 minutes after finishing the starters. Place was not busy or packed at the time. The waiter felt like she was doing us a favor by even serving us. Also, this place serves the worst mojito in history."
Mother just puked from bad fish and prawns. I feel nauseated and i only took veggie meal... how is that possible. Never again sorry.
"From the outside this restaurant is in a very beautiful location overlooking a historic and picturesque part of Ghent. The menu has a lot of variety. Step inside and we were greeted by a waiter who showed us to a table. Once we sat down we were left to our own devices. I repeatedly asked for his attention but was ignored. It was apparent that he heard me trying to get his attention as after three attempts he told me ""this is how we do it here"" asking me to wait in a very patronising and hostile tone. If the waiter does not want to do his job then we didn't think to stay to be intimidated further and made to feel uncomfortable. Would not wish this experience on other travellers. "
"I've there with a friend. Atmosfere was quite nice and the food too. Service....I was shocked by it. Never happened to me to have a waitress/owner i don't know shouting to me just because we asked to pay separately, And, not only she was not undarstanding what i was asking because she could't speak english (even with dutch didn't work....she was not listening at all), she have been the worst host ever, rude and unpleasant. She made a very easy and kind request like the I was asking not to pay, and all people sitting inside and outside have seen it. I didn't accept her behaviour and i pretended to pay separately...and people after me were going to do the same when I left, just to let her understand that you should be nice with your customerNever again"
The title says everything.The staff was not willing to serve us properly. It was like they vowed not to smile ever!Highly not recommended.
"Four of us popped inside for a waffle and a drink at lunchtime on 15th September. Granted, all the restaurants were busy because of the music festival but 4 plain waffles, 3 hot chocolates and a beer is not a complicated order. For this waiter it was. I'd put it down to his poor English but his English was fine. We only received three waffles and a beer. After twice asking the waiter where the hot drinks were, I had to go to the counter to ask what had happened to the drinks which were finally delivered, which by now weren't very hot. We waited for the fourth waffle for some time only to be told that we'd only ordered 3 - this is in spite of the fact that we'd been given 4 sets of cutlery. Given how much time had now passed, we gave up on the 4th waffle. Trying to get the bill was also problematic - it took three requests before it was dumped on the table. Needless to say, we won't be going back."
"The waitress wasn't friendly at all , we had to wait more then 20 minutes for a beverage , we had the briouates and harira soup as a starter , and Tajine with chicken as a main , the food was bland not seasoned properly and definitely not worth to be called authentic Moroccan cuisine . I myself am half-Moroccan make killer tajines and we travel by 4X4 to Southern Morocco almost every year and this is by far the worst Moroccan food I have tasted . I am flabbergasted by the positive comments on here . Either they have never tasted the real deal or they prefer bland food . My wife, 15 year old daughter and myself had the exact same opinion about this place . Not friendly , not authentic , not good Not worth it !!"
"Don't bother with this bar, I am not sure if the barman doesn't like the English or doesn't like anyone. We went in for drinks, I was asking questions about the beers, etc etc, to say the man was ignorant was an understatement. Totally no customer engagement and definitely not worth visiting. Take my advice and walk a few doors along the t'Gedult, different class altogether and so friendly."
"Klokhuys restaurant was a shockingly bad experience for us. The place totally lacked atmosphere and it was empty except a couple who was already eating their main course when we had arrived. We placed our orders and had to wait more than 1 hour only to be told they had a ""computer problem"" which resulted in our orders being lost... What, why didn't they just communicate /double-check with their cook, they didn't seem to have anything else to do at the time as no other customers were waiting for food! It is actually pretty hard for a restuarant to provide such appalling service. We just got up and left; during our extensive travels we never came across such bad service in a restaurant. Please avoid this place."
"Expecting a delicious confection, I was horrified at the over sugared and artificially creamed disaster of a ""milk shake"" on offer. To make the situation worse, only paying customers are allowed to sit. My 80 year old mother had to stand while my daughter tried to consume her treat."
"I went there with 2 friends on Saturday, we were 3 women in our fifties. We wanted an early meal, the time was 5pm. When entering we asked if it was possible to get a meal at that time and the waiter said yes. The restaurant was empty, nevertheless we could not choose table as they said all other table were reserved (there were no signs on the tables about this). As this was early, at 5pm, and we were gonig to have a quick meal, I asked for what time the nice round table was reserved, and they said 5:30 pm. Ok for us, and we sat down by the first table they gave us and waited for the menu. Suddely the chef shouted out that the kitchen was closed, and then he shouted again that the kitchen was closed. We asked the waitress if this was true, and she said it was because I had asked about the round table. We had to leave. I have never in my life experiencxed anything like it. We left and had a meal at the restuarant next door. All restaurants in that square were almost full, exept for Neptune. If they are closely as rude to other guests as to us I understand why. Never go there."
"We found this place wondering around Ghent in search of finding a warm place for a lunch. We have ordered soup of the day which ended up to be a delcious tomatoe soup and a plate of french fries. In the menu card the french fries where mentioned as a side dish for EUR2.50. The surprise was when we have recieved a bill, with price for the fries of EUR5.00. And it would not be that bad to pay this price for fries in a restaurant but a pity is that we were not informed that fries as a separate dish is not really mentioned in the menu. When we tried to dispute the price we heard only things like:- it is very cheap to pay EUR5.00 for a place of fries- we do not actually serve fries as a separate dish- it is the lesson for the future we should be more detailed in the menu, etc.Of course we paid, but it was a bit annoying, especially that really nice, thick. Belgium fries are on the street for much lower price."
We stopped for drinks and ice cream. The waiter didn’t speak English and in the end we couldn’t have ice cream because kitchen was closed in a Sunday with the city full of tourists and the restaurant belongs to Marriot! They mention sorbet but in reality it’s ice cream. Beware lactose sensitive people! Terrible experience stay away 
Had lunch here and paid 35 euro for OK spaghetti. Was very crowded and there was a mixup with the change (they miscalculated... We paid in full).Somehow they found the time to note our license plate (?!) and waste our time with a police report over... 6 euro they coulnt find. Would never go again.
I can summarize my visit in one word: Horrible. The beef was so undercooked it started eating the salad. My water glass was stained with lipstick and had bits of food floating in it. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE!'
"I came in with my friends to order lunch. I had half a bottle of coke with me from my previous exploring of the city. After ordering our food I was told I wasn't allowed to drink my drink because it's 'a restaurant', even though my friends and I had all ordered food and drinks. The waitress was very rude about it. It's just not something you expect when you have just ordered over 40€ of food and drink. Overall not a friendly atmosphere! "
"Good thing about restaurants is you can make a reservation well up front to be sure you can enjoy a nice dinner on Friday evening. However in a restaurant like Per Bacco this simply doesn't matter, so why bother, they for sure don't! Upon arrival (on time, as reserved) they told us a group came in without reservation and they used all available tables to place this group. We were asked to wait a bit and were placed aside. As the entire group entered it became quickly obvious that a nice dinner would not be possible, the restaurant became more like a noisy cantine.As ""compensation"" we were offered a glass of bad quality prosecco and 3 olives, which we left almost untouched. Luckily we did find another good restaurant where they do understand how people want to get treated when going out for dinner. The food I cannot comment on, but I do know, no matter how good it might have been (or not), such people shouldn't have a restaurant, as they don't realize having a restaurant simply isn't only about serving food!See you never again Per Bacco!Maarten V"
"5 adults. reserved for dinner on Saturday evening. not abnormally many people. filled for 1/4. After about 30 minutes I started ordering drinks at the bar and looking for the menus. A bottle of Cava is brought and placed on the table without serving and without snacks. After having waited for a long period of time, I started to ask if we could order. In the meantime I pick up a bottle of white wine at the bar, here too some service is totally absent, an ice bucket or cooler is totally absent. 1 hour and 10 minutes later I started to ask if we could expect our food. The food was served about 10 minutes later and that was a real disappointment. I am 55 years old and I go to the restaurant very regularly, but both myself and my guests have partly left their dishes because it was simply bad. I will not waste any further words on this but can only advise you not to go there unless you want to be cheated."
Smallest portion. Not worthy. Pick another restaurant !!! Expensive. Waiters don't even get feedbacks. Pointless the visit
"This weird restaurant with terrible atmosphere of old granny house and even worse food is the worst experience for the money we spend. Not only that a salad starts from 25€ but they did not have ANY meal with chicken, pork or beef. Food had such terrible taste I couldn't eat more than half of the starter. But if you are a snob who wants to spend money for nothing - go for it.. Oh and if your card isn't Visa ot American express prepare to go to the ATM."
"I heard some reviews that this was a good restaurant, so I wanted to check this out.By the time we could order our menu, we were already waiting 30 minutes. By the time we got our menu we could wait for another hour. We thought ok, maybe it'll be very special .... well I thought wrong ... when we got our meal it looked special at first sight, and that's all there is to say about it.Waiting that long, paying so much and not getting the quality you pay for, is sad.We won't come back."
Not a nice place if you're after quality and class.
A restaurant refusing to serve a dessert because they are too busy that’s for me inacceptable!I travel around the world and had sometimes bad restaurant experiences but this never happened anywhere.At least now I know it exists and it is next door... well what else! Just never again Il Giadino in Sint Niklaas
"The price is obviously too expensive, 73 Euros for 4 balls and drinks!!! The bread was very hard and we couldn't eat it."
"Ordered a red wine and a pad Thai with prawns. Red wine was like vinegar and had to send it back. The pad Thai was terrible, uncooked noodles, overcooked prawns (very tough and dry), not a good pad Thai flavour and no peanuts on top (pad Thai was 14.50€.) I would not recommend the non-sushi food here...big disappointment. "
"Slow.poorly served waited ages.
Shame lovely place
Will not return
Wreford and Fielders in Ghent.
Cheers"
"The menu sounds nice, but the experience quickly goes downhill as soon as you're seated. Over fifteen minute wait to get a menu and receive it after two tables that have come in after you? Check. Then wait half an hour for them to take the order, again after those other late-comers' tables? Check.Drinks another wait? Yep. We are now nearly an hour and a half in and not a crumb of food. Lots of people leaving, paying for drinks but getting in arguments about not paying for food that never showed.Can't wait to see if they add a service charge...Come here if you can't find any dog faeces or broken glass to eat from the road. At least with those you'll get something in your stomach."
"Very bad food, not fresh, irrespective​ behavior, requires renovation...Not sure where to start! The couple sitting next to us complained about their pizzas, without us realising. Suddenly, the chef came out of the kitchen with a tray full of pizza raw doughs shouting at them and asking them if these doughs don't look fresh to them. We found it very rude... then it was our turn... we ordered bruscettas, which were not in the menu. The bread was not fresh, then our main dishes... the waitress comes with a canelloni stuffed with meat, although my partner ordered with spinach. She asked him if it is ok because the chef misread the order. They knew their mistake and did not correct it. Then my dish...I ordered taglatielle gorgonzola, which looked like a soup, cooked in the oven, I found a hair and there were 2 different types of tagliatelle in... what else to describe? I am wondering for all the above good reviews...Never again !!!"
"Italian cooking being my favorite one, I perfectly know that I can't expect the same quality and taste as in Italy (where cheap and average restaurants already equal expensive and sophisticated Italian restaurants in Belgium). Having said that and knowing perfectly that I can't expect such high standards, this was one of the worst pizza I ever had in my entire life!! (either in Italy, Belgium, America or wherever).You think I'm exaggerating and you want to check by yourself? Well if you have some time and money to lose and if nothing pleases you as much as an expensive (for such bad food, every price is too high btw) and tasteless meal served by unfriendly people, Il Cortile might well be your happy place ;)"
"The Sunday brunch that they offer for 32 euro per person is absolutely not worth it, in my opinion this was only worth 20 euros at most. The soup tasted like they dropped the whole pepper mill in it, the service was slow, the pastries were dry, the selection was fairly limited and everything was just really average. I had much higher expectations given the asking price. Three people of our group, including myself, even found hair in their food (in my quiche), disgusting.The restaurant itself was fairly nice decorated, although I didn't get the ""everything in pink"" concept and it made the place feel a bit shoddy. The waitresses were dressed quite sleazy with these pink short skirts, and were acting overly friendly, but definitely not sincere.A good alternative Sunday brunch I would suggest is Tables d'Alix, similar in name, but the quality and variety of food there is far superior, and it's even quite a bit cheaper."
"Totally unfair behavior. If you like to be mocked, waiting for half an hour for your turn to sit, while they will first accomodate all their friends/favorite ones, as they are the owners and you are no-one, this is your place. Congratulations to both the bossy owner and to the “confused” waitress.Of course, to justify themselves they will tell you their “friends” had reserved… but they forget people have eyes and can see everything.See you never!"
"I rarely post reviews on here, but am moved to now because of the incredibly rude service at Allegro Moderato. We arrived to be greeted by a grimacing waiter who then showed us to our table with a casual wave of his hand, as he walked away. When we asked why there were only two starters and two mains, the same waiter told us that they were so busy that was all the chef wanted to do. The set menu was the two starters and two mains put together, plus a desert, which seems incredible for a restaurant of this calibre. We quickly decided to leave but when my brother approached the same waiter to apologise and explain, he put his arm up and pushed past him. I see a lot of positive reviews on here, so maybe it just an off night. But it was what it was - a very poor experience."
"Our table has been ignored by staff from beginning till end of the evening. We had to wait 50 (!) min. to get our drinks and more than 90 min to get the first food. We had to ask for the menus many times before getting them, ask to order, ...The food is very good though. What a pity! "
Terrible food! I am writing this review as I’m leaving this place…Our food arrived cold! We had to wait 50min for 2 other mezzes to arrive so we decided to leave.The staff is friendly yes but they are not organised at all. The kitchen is dirty and so are the toilets. We had a horrible experience here and left disgusted with an empty stomach.I do not understand how this place got “popular” on Instagram. It’s definitely not what it looks like on social media. We asked for a refund of the food which arrived late. The waitress was not nice to us but now she came back with dessert to make it up :)We regret not reading the negative reviews before deciding to enter.
First night and was hungry.  Beautiful building but the service was vile as was the endless ribs. No smiles offered and price was ok. Expect to pay around €20 for a meal and 1 drink
"I don't understand what the fuss is about. They make simple food, I love simple food, I cook it at home everyday. But to ask so high prices for it? It's a stunning location, but you can also see it if you just go for a drink, and then afterwards, go to a balanced price/quality restaurant."
"Ordered the Holstein steak as it was presented as the chefs selection. It had multiple tendons, too much fat plus it was much too rare even though I ordered it as medium. Staff is partly unfriendly and not forthcoming even after providing honest feedback about the meal. I was expecting something very different especially for those prices. This place will never see me again. Can not recommend this restaurant whatsoever."
"Four of us waited a long time for a waiter, then told the monthly menu was only available if the whole table wanted it as it causes too much work for the chef ... but we could order exactly the same off the carte at an increased price! Then our waiter decided just to walk away while we were ordering and start serving other tables. Came back after another waitress asked us what the problem was, but no apology from either. Incredible, never experienced such rude service in Belgium. We left and took our custom to Den Boskouter in Erpe-Mere."
"The restaurant looks really nice inside, but that's the only good thing. Me, my daughter and husband went there for a quick meal, as we had been driving all day. We had to wait at least 45 minutes for our dinner. I asked after half an hour and they said it was coming. Another 15 minutes later my chicken and my husband's spare ribs both arrived undercooked and raw in the middle. We didn't eat the meal and we just wanted to leave, as we were tired. My husband went to tell the owner that we would pay for the coffees, but not the meal. The owner didn't believe us the meal was not cooked and my husband had to bring her to the table to show her the meal.The waiters were a bit rude and the manager was even ruder about the situation. No sincere apologies were made, only snide remarks. I would not recommend this place, as it was also quite expensive. It is a bog standard restaurant with poor service and poor food quality, masquerading as a decent restaurant. Save your money and make the short trip to Gent or another local restaurant."
Pfff... Too expensive and not very good...
"Went for lunch with a family group of 4 adults. Initial interaction was pleasant and innocuous, we received drinks quickly. Thereafter waiter pointedly refused to return to our table and we were not able to order lunch. Restaurant was busy but not excessively so and we were the only people in our section. We would have been happy to wait, or leave earlier had request or explanation been offered but none was. After approximately 30 minutes we decided to go elsewhere and had a pleasant, drama free lunch in a restaurant down the street."
"It was a while since we visited this restaurant, unfortunately a lot changed in that period.The service was extremely fast, only 10 minutes after our order we received our meal. Fresh? I think not. Waiters put an empty saltshaker on our table, after taking a filled one from another table they took away the full one. This is just an example of one of the mistakesEverything seemed as if they just wanted their revenue as fast as possible. When I wanted to pay with my card I typed in the code but did not notice anything happening. Fortunately I did not press 'ok' because the first screen was to give the waiters a tip. I almost gave them a +€50 tip without noticing and the waiter did not mention it. I pressed cancel, typed in the code and got out there as fast as possible. We were in and out in approxamitely 40 minutes. Ideal restaurant if you are a tourist and just want a quick meal and nothing more. Horrible restaurant if you are thinking about having a cosy night out."
"The pasta like instant noodles, and no service at all, even the restaurant is not occupied at mid of the day."
Not worth a visit.  There are plenty of decent Italian restaurants in town so why bother visiting the Pizza hut?!
We called in here today during a day trip to Ghent. We ordered and our drinks arrived but the food never came despite a polite reminder after 45 minutes. We were about to leave and it arrived. I asked for the bill and that didn’t come either. Other tables were being served promptly with food and drinks leaving me to wonder if they don’t like English people. There are plenty of places to eat in Ghent so we certainly wouldn’t go back. 
The most slow service i have had in my life...waitress was very rude and not helpful at all..food mediocre...stay away not recommend at all!!
"The server screamed at use for eating leftover fries of a friend who gave it to us because it's ""bad for business"" and ordered us to throw an untouched portion of fries away. Then we wanted to drink water from our bottles and he told us we can't (which we understood and stopped doing). And then when one of us wanted to go to toilet and fill the bottles for our next trip, the waiter told us we can't even do that. Food was good but expensive and the service and overall treatment was absolutely awful. Do NOT recommend. "
"I ate in this restaurant and never again will I let myself in ... A dull, dead, disassociated restaurant, and the food feels like it's frozen. My husband and I ordered a seafood spaghetti and a parmesan scallop ... we were more than shocked, the quality does not exist pre-cooked fish and scallop that had more than 3 layers of breading ... Horrible and nauseating"
"I will not note anything about the food but about the unprofessional attitude. I asked twice what were the possibilities for people with food intolerances... Twice, they read my message ... Do people know that the sender knows when it's read?! .. Twice this got flatly ignored.Get real and tumble down your pedestal! Having a mention in the Gault & Millau doesn't prevent you from being polite and commercial... On the contrary!Small(er) establishments have no issue to answer swiftly, whether this answer is positive or not.Unbelievable."
"We have been here two times. The first time they just opened and gave us the wrong order. That's ok, those things happen when you just open your business. However after a few months we got back and nothing changed. Wrong order delivered again, really overpriced, small portions and unenthousiastic staff. They were working with 4 people, yet they managed to lose control as soon as there are more than 2 people waiting. Which is normal when you run only one order at a time.Unfortunately it was the last time we got our food there. Even for tourists there are better places to find your Belgian fries in the city centre."
"While the staff was kind, they were incredibly disorganized. The food was dry and obviously pre-made, while still coming out cold. We were brought the wrong food several times and overall had a terrible experience. The food was incredibly overpriced for small, cold portions."
Do not visit! We are well travelled (work on a yacht literally visiting hundreds of countries a year) and originally from London. Regarding the food (we always eat curry in different countries and have visited India and Goa many times) was AWFUL and nothing at all like what it should of tasted like (we ordered chicken vindaloo and prawn madras) firstly the blonde waitress was so rude I even had to ask her “is there a problem?” We didn’t get cutlery or napkins and the table was filthy! Then we were served old horrible poppadoms which we sent back and were replaced and alongside came a TINY pot of mango “sauce” not chutney (approx 1 teaspoon) the food was bland and tasteless and the white rice it came with had been sitting out for many hours. They also only had a choice of 3 NAAN breads as the “kitchen was busy” the menus and floor are dirty and to charge 17 euros for the vindaloo and 23 euros for the madras was disgusting. Worse curry place EVERDoNot go!!
"We called in to Mosquito Coast for a coffee and something to eat. We sat down at a table and went through the menu. Nobody approached us for 10 minutes so one of the group went to the bar to order. We were informed that we would have to move tables if we wished to order something so we did. A waitress then appeared and started to clear the table all the time grunting at us before returning behind the bar. Feeling unwelcome, we decided to leave. I cannot comment on how good or bad the food is here as we did not have any but the staff need to realise that they are in the hospitality industry. There are plenty of nice places to eat in Ghent without having to deal with this ignorance."
"While the decor is splendid, its better that you just walk in to see it, take some photos (don't worry, the service is so poor that they won't even notice you), and then leave. There must be an inside joke to this place, because it's absolutely horrible when it comes to knowing what exactly you are able to order; the menu is written on the mirror-covered walls and it is difficult to both read it and understand what items are available to order. There is only one kind of rib marinade, and it is an overly sweetened concoction that the chef stole from Chinese spare-rib recipes. After receiving the worst service I have ever received after living in Ghent for two years, our bs evening was topped off with my father-in-law being charged for a small glass of tap water that he needed in order to take his medicine. Go to Gekroode Hoofden instead, as it has much better service and a wide range of rib marinades/sauces."
"Very Nice pizza's, We reserved, but after two hours we saw the -presumable- boss watch our table, hoping we'd leave. And then she came and asked us to leave. Thought that was pretty impolite, since we reserved and only stayed two hours and payed 18€ Per pizza and we were still finishing out wine. "
"We went in with a group of friends and sat on a big table and the waitress started to give insulting comments about us going directly to the table even though the restaurant was almost empty. After, she comes to give as menus again and was very rude so we just left the place. Too bad it seemed cozy but we felt it was the worst service we have ever received. No smiles, no customer friendliness. Felt like she just wanted to get rid of us. "
"No atmosphere, crammed in for the 9pm sitting. Chaos and confusion & very loud. I ordered the 'fish' menu, but was given the wrong coloured plate ( how was I supposed to know?) I waited while others around received the skimpy slivers of meat. No one complained about the taste, just the lack of never seeing the waiter again for another 10-15 mins. But they are confident that you will tuck into the the pre-prepared salad and fill yourself on garlic bread. Meanwhile still not had any 'fish' on my plate. Eventually I managed to grab the attention of a waitress to ask when the fish was going to arrive. Eventually, two small cubes of salmon a cube of a white fish and about 10 prawns, that was it ! A grilled piece of pineapple was the last thing thrown at people. Dreadful service, not much food and 120 Euros for a family of 3. Disgraceful."
Their spaghetti bolognaise cost only 6 euros but is terrible. Sauce is not home made and comes from industrial made food cans. Salads are ok here.
"Unfortunately this restaurant do not accept the vaccination document in paper. Only QR code on mobile so Tourists from abroad cannot eat there because they don’t know how to read and identify abroad documents. This is the only restaurant in Gent that do not accept abroad document. The others are all reading, asking questions, being friendly to understand and accepting. Regrettable."
"I went with a group who had ordered their meal options two weeks in advance – so they knew we were comingWe arrived at 6.30pm – early signs were good with delicious warm bread, the starters arrived about an hour later and mains about two and a half hours after we arrived!In the interests of fairness I will say that the food when it eventually arrived was very good; except for the fish which had dried out badly in the two hours we were both waiting for each other.The service was begrudging and inept – I have been to restaurants were they can carry more than one plate at a time.Dessert did arrive fairly promptly (albeit one plate at a time) but by then the damage had been done.We finished the meal at 10.15pm – frankly if I have been the proprietor I would have thrown my hands up, accept it had been a debacle and substantially reduced the bill."
"I didn't even make it into the restaurant. I tried to make a reservation for 14 (!!!) persons, as a goodbye lunch for colleagues. When I politely asked if they spoke English, the woman answered a rude ""no"" and then hung up on me. Need I say more?"
"It already took some time for the waiters to come to order our drinks, but almost 2 hours of waiting time for a pasta is too long, which by the way was overcooked and not very special. You expect something more for a pasta that costs € 19! Maybe the waiters have to stop smoking and drinking during their working hours, one of them smelled he just smoked cigarettes, meanwhile we were waiting so long for our dinner, they were drinking beer behind the bar. Very unprofessional. Due to the long waiting time and the unprofessional service, we didn't order any dessert anymore and we left. Next time in Belgium, we won't repeat this disaster."
"Side salad missing, raw onions in the burger, no straws nor paper towels for our take-away order. I've worked in a McDonald's and I can tell it does not take 10minutes to get an order ready in a fast food."
"Cheap but bad food! 
The food seems fake. 
It doesn’t look clean either. 
Don’t eat there...we should have gone somewhere else"
"We ordered some food, it was not that great. The service was average. They charged us 85 euro for an average bottle of champagne. Furthermore they charged us also some dishes we didn't even order!! When we informed the owner she started yelling at us and blaming us for calling her a liar. The same happened to my friend."
"Visited Nam Jai for dinner while in Ghent with 3 friends. Ordered our meals, waited quite a while for these to arrive but saw others meals arriving and they looked greatWhen our meals did turn up (4 meals) on my first mouthful I had a big black hair in it ! (Blonde so definitely not mine !!) when we called the waiter over and told him about it quietly as not to cause a scene , he said nothing, no sorry or il get you another meal , he simply took the plate quickly and walked away. While the other 3 in our group finished their meals we assumed they must be remaking my meal.Apparently not. After everyone else finishing and waiting, without the waiter having approached us once, we then asked about the meal. He left then came back and said it would be a wait. I had already been waiting over half an hour while everyone else ate and wasn't prepared to sit for another half an hour. Still no apology at all about the meal with the hair in or no alternative offered. When we collected the bill the waiter was rude, STILL no apology. The food we did receive was fine but was not all impressed at the service we received and the fact I left without having a meal. He didn't even offer us my drink (€3) free seen as I now had to go somewhere else , while everyone else in my party went off for drinks, to go and get a different dinner. I wouldn't no recommend going here "
"My wife and I visited Jigger's on 15th November 2012, a Thursday night, and were met at the door by the hostess who inquired as to whether we had a reservation which we didn't . She said the bar area was full . Since it was cold outside, we asked if we could wait in the foyer till a place was available, at which point she said she would ask the manager. She returned from within the bar and asked us to come back after half an hour . What was disconcerting ,was , whilst we were waiting another couple just walked in .I would like to give the place the benefit of the doubt but I got the clear impression that the bar was following a discriminatory police against non-Europeans.i would have liked to visit the bar as we had heard it was a great place but this experience left a bad taste in the mouth. I am aware that some places ""screen"" their guests if they are casually dressed but both of us were as appropriately dressed as the other couple which I mentioned."
"going to a fast food restaurant and having to wait more than an hour after ordering, then being said: it is really busy, but seeing that all people that arrived after you got their dinner and already left. after waiting for another 10 minutes and getting this excuse again, we just took are vests and left...no real excuses made by staff or actions taken to help us with our order, so very poor service and hospitality..."
"Ever since Nadine got rid of her much loved friture near the railway, we were wondering how her new brasserie would do. To be honest, until previous week we haven't managed to visit T Spoorke. Nadine is long gone, but judging the clients (mostly elderly locals) we were under the impression this might be a well kept secret. My wife went for the home made burger, I opted for the gamba's. 40 minutes later our plates arrived. A quick peek under the burger bun and the first alarm bell went off; the patty surface was burnt , just like the onions. The surviving meat, dry and over done. Same story with the gamba's. If there was a distinguishable taste it was oily and tasteless. Awful. Avoid like the plague"
"My husband asked about cheese when ordering his starter as he can’t eat it. The waitress didn’t think to mention that the main course he’d ordered - a fish stew - is covered in cheese. When it arrived she said it’s only a little bit. Actually it was a lot, and it makes him ill. I had the same main course. It was horrible. You couldn’t taste the fish for the greasy cheesy sauce. I like both fish and cheese, but really disliked this meal. The waitress didn’t tell the manager about our concerns, we had to seek him out.My advice - go somewhere else.Restaurant - if you’re reading this - invest in some staff training "
45min wait for a mcdonalds like breakfast. Service was a disaster. Food mediocre. Expensive for what you get. They brought the coffee and 30min later the food. The coffee was bad. When we complained the waiter only answered that it was busy. There are far much better options in Ghent rather than this place.
We used to come here some 4 to 5 times a year but this time the fajita was below everything. It was nothing compared to an imitation from a TEX-MEX restaurant and not the word fajita worth.There were much to many onions and garlic and the beef was cut and then cooked so it became leather.We gave our dishes almost completely back and on the remarks the waiter only could say that the ingredients were well weighted. Much too expensive for what you get!!!
"We visited here after seeing all the positive reviews on TA, but unfortunately our visit was well below our expectations. We had the fried party box to start with which was very poor, and came out similar to what would be found frozen in a supermarket. For the main I had Seli's noodles with a black bean sauce. The homemade noodles themselves were very good and the duck nice, but the sauce was very bland and did not resemble a black bean sauce at all. For some reason there were an awful lot of carrots in the dish but not a lot else. Aside from the food the service was good and toilets nice & clean. In terms of value, at €50 for a starter each, two mains and a drink each, I would expect much higher quality."
"We visited the place with my girlfriend and 2 more friends. The place is really beautiful located by the river with a magnificent view, this was the reason we selected it but unfortunately it was an absolute bust... We were 4 people. After checking the overpriced menu, we ordered scambi with fries (25.5) , vegetarian wok (19.5), a steak -medium cooked (19.5) and a spaghetti bolognese (16.5) with an extra portion of fries. When the food arrived we had our first surprise, the brought us a single portion of fries, we asked the waiter that brought if it was for the scampi or it was the extra portion ordered from my friend and he answered it was for the scampi... we waited 5-10 for the extra portion to arrive but in vain. So we asked the initial waiter who took the order and he told us that both the portions are in this bowl (bowl of the same size as in all of their menus and not extra size) and if we wish after finishing them he can refill it..... Then when my girlfriend pointed out that her steak was not medium and it was even closer to raw than rare (picture attached), the waiter agreed that it was a mistake of the chef but did nothing to correct it..... Furthermore my friend who order the bolognese spaghetti (she was italian) mentioned that is barely any meat in in the sauce the waiter replied rudely that he does not care how the bolognese is made in Italy that is the ""percentage"" of meat they add in their restaurant.... It was in general a really bad experience and i would definitely not recommend this place"
"We went for dinner with my husband on Saturday night. Normally, not our go-to for a Sicilian restaurant in Gent, but we thought lets give it a try. Where to begin....We ordered a bottle of their Tuscany wine and went for full course meals: 3 dishes of their 'fish menu' and 3 dishes of their vegetarian menu. Not one single of the 6 dishes was worth it. Especially not worthy it for a bill of 150euros (150!!!) for two people. Normally we are into experiencing new places and do not really try to look for prices of dishes and things we order, as long as they are good. BUT, when you pay this much for a dinner for 2, you wanna have some decent food. Two of our dishes (the antipasti and the main course) we didnt not even finish, it was that bad. Service was nice, but that is never going to compensate for your terrible food. At an Italian restaurant, how much does it get to make a very-very bad pasta??"
"The food was terrible and had no flavour.
It was also crazy expensive and not worth the money at all. Don’t go here!!"
The staff was horrible to us. We had to ask 2 times to order and even then it took 30 minutes. Our food took more than 1 hour to arrive and it wasn’t even complete. We needed to ask for our side dishes as well. Moreover the prices are too high for the quality.
"not vegan friendly restaurant.The only vegan food they were willing to serve was pure asparagus with a green salad, for an exessive price of 28€. Plus the service was moody and not even on requests willing to turn on the heating, even though it was very cold. Would never go there again."
"The food was ok but the owner was something terrible. I booked for 25 people and he did not want to make more than 15 pizzas, came up with silly excuses. Instead of being glad to have so many people there he was quite complaining about us. He was very rude with all of us and it looked like he was giving us a favour, unbelievable! The waiters were great, very kind and helpful. At the end of the evening we felt like people who did something wrong instead of guests. I do not recommend this place at all."
"Me and my friends went here today for lunch. The waiter was very quick in taking us our beverages. However, 40 minutes later, there was no sign of our meal, nor any apology for being so late. 10 minutes later we ask for the bill, since it is not possible to wait for almost an hour! Again, no apology from the staff.I am really disappointed (and I can say for sure that another table had the same problem, since they leave the restaurant after 1 hour, without any signs of the lunch!)"
"If this is the best pizza in Ghent, I am afraid to find out what everyone else is serving. We were a group of 4 (2 locals, 2 tourists), and visited because of good reviews (on a variety of review sites). Unfortunately, the service was agonizingly slow, and the pizza was awful. The dirt-cheap prices should have tipped us off. Anyhow, it was all a soggy tasteless mess. Very disappointed."
"Terrible improvised food, salad without feta olives and onions but plenty of mayonnaise!!
Worst moussaka ever tried
My wife can make a better tzatziki..."
"We got the wrong order, as we reclaimed the stuff was unfriendly and said we ordered wrong. But in fact the only right thing in the order was my beer. The wine was wrong and warm, both meals were wrong. as I began to insist to get the right order, the stuff didn't wanted to get the right, because the need to throw away the wrong order. As I began to strongly insist and raise my voice the we got the right order. But not without mocking comments off the stuff. The restrooms are also dirty. And the doorman is always busy to get customers which walk by. We chose is because you have a nice place in the sun, outside on a terrace. The meals were okay, nothing special. I would go elsewhere next time, even with nice stuff. "
"Terrible place - horrible food-
Don't eat the pasta's.
Go there if all other brasseries are closed."
"Over all a disappointing meal! We went for dinner last night, having been recommended this place by several people. It was busy, but not full to capacity. So did we order incorrectly I hear you ask.....My partner had the carpaccio, which was so thinly sliced and over powered with Parmesan it was forgettable. I ordered he steak tartare, from the main menu for a starter. I was very disappointed that all the usual side ingredients were already mixed into the 'mince' which was again disappointing. Lacked taste! Main courses, my partner ordered the North Sea Catch and was pleasantly surprised, yet the meal very white! I ordered the steak. Where do I start? The meat was cooked to perfection, just lacked any taste. The bearnaise sauce lacked taste and was very runny, and the salad, was lettuce and cucumber..... very unimaginative! We the decided to just get the bill and leave. We were in there a grand total of 90mins.... so much for a nice relaxed meal....Would I recommend this place? Absolutely not. There are better places to go for the money and quality, rather than this over priced restaurant. "
"Visited with two friends March 1st 2020. Two eating one just having a drink. Ordered an Orval beer which came completely flat, waiter very argumentative about replacing when it was clearly bad. Spaghetti came as disgusting congealed lump and request for olive oil ignored. Frits were ok but scampi very chewy. The two who ate became very ill a few hours later. Coincidence? Bad food and bad service, one to avoid."
Has a menu to deceive tourists. Beware the whole chicken costs 27 euros and not 13.50 with the menu inducing you to think. The service and the food are horrible.It was the worst experience of my entire 20 day trip through europe.
Worst service ever!!!!!! They write things on the menu and you order and suddenly they say ... we have just changed our menu. One tipp to the owner: stop your restaurant. You and your team have no clue how to handle guests!!!!👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Been here 3 times of the past year... 3 worst cups of coffee in my life. They should really fix that. It shouldn't even been called coffee...
"Stayed at the Marriott , the wife and I frequent steak houses in the state. Our favorite is Ruth Chris by far with many close seconds. Was expecting a good steak based on the build up to aged beef being offered. We were totally disappointed the beef was tough , rubbery and not well seasoned. It also took over 45 minutes to get our order. When you are dishing $60 euros for a steak, you are expecting close to perfection far from it.Can’t blame the service as they were friendly can only blame the Chef, defenetly will not recommend for steaks."
"It takes a lot to get me to leave a really poor review.However,While ordering or meals, we were told a dish we ordered was not available. (Mussels....)So, instead of giving us a second to look thru the menu for another item, when we asked the female server to come back while we looked, she got an attitude, rolled her eyes, mumbled something and stormed off.There are just too many GOOD places in this area to eat at, to put up with just plain rudeness. We paid for our drinks, and left to another eatery nearby."
"Coeur d’artichaut is lacking all of the essentials to a satisfying experience: lack of honesty, originality, authenticity, inspiration and quality. They are pure bluff. Don't spend your money here. There are too many good other restaurants in Ghent.

"comming in at 14.00h, tje waiter was already looking his watch. realy a bad experiance, food & staff at the same level. not good at all"
"Very rude, cashier didn't bother to say hi or thank you, asked me ""what's that?"" whilst nodding her head at my plate, kept talking with her colleague and didn't even look at me."
"Most  people try to move forwards in ""ecology"" & ""Animal Wellfare"".  Including kangaroo in the daily menu is sick !  Sick !!!"
"Food not worth the money. Feeling treated like unwanted guests. At the end being ""kicked out"" by rolling in the marquee...
Never again 

(PS: avoid visiting the restroom!!)"
Eight of us sat down and a waitress came over...she was extremely rude and walked off.  We got up and went.  A very strange way to run a business.
"The worst waffles I tried in my life, they were dry like a paper and cold so I assume they weren’t freshly made. And I paid 8,5 euro for that. My fiancé ordered croque monster which was just two toasts and a ham with cheese in between and it cost 11.80 euro!!! Unbelievable! Extremely poor quaality and they seem to get away with that because it is a tourist place ! "
I tried a delivery by UberEats as for some dark reason this restaurant only wants to work with the lower quality delivery services in Ghent. Unfortunately it took one hour to get cold dripping spare ribs. Which I refused. Get your s* together.
"We came here with a Bongo-bon which was valid according to the website. But when we arrived, they said it wasn’t valid on weekends. Little detail: when we made the reservation, we mentioned that we had this Bongo giftcard! So, villa Clochard is a no go for us!"
"We ordered pizza and pasta. Everyone that came after us got the food and we were still waiting so after more than one hour we asked if it was going to take much longer. Apparently they forgot about us and the guy didn't even come to say I'm sorry. Poor service and average food. The prices are too high for what you get. There are much nicer places in Gent to have dinner, avoid this one!"
"Customer service was awful, food was tasteless, impolite response when the items in their menu are not available, clear distinction in welcoming and treating Europeans and Indians, such a pity that it's an Indian restaurant. I would strongly advise everyone to avoid this place because of their distasteful customer service and food. Cherry on the cake, they respond in very abusive manner to bad reviews."
"Tried the waterzooi, well, I do not know if it's called water something, but the soup is way too watery. And the chicken is too dry. My colleagues ordered the beef stew, they thought it's good though."
"Another Good, Bad and Ugly review, unfortunately this place is only Fugly!!!Me and the GF wanted to taste some local Belgian food and went to this hell hole, so that's 1 arabic looking mauritian and a vietnamese ordering stoverij.At first I thought, the waiter was just being rude because of our skin colour! serious case of racism going on, being the kind of person I am I wanted how ugly he could get. After a few loud remarks whether we were receiving such rude attitude because of our ethnicity, this atmosphere changed dramatically...No more eye contact!!! Sorry but they created this animosity, it was literally a matter of ""can I have 1 more beer please"", and ""1 sec"" response, but the beer came, ""The meal was wonderful can I have the bill please""... The longer the talking got the more unbearable it was...Anyway, the stowerij was OK but the atmosphere dead as a cemetery which does not surprise me and at least now I know that everyone else seems to be treated the same here.I begin regretting not going for the menu of the day for 10 Euros at ""Het groot vleeshuis"" rabbit soup, at least the welcome was friendly!!!"
Visited this place in April. My friend and I ordered food. She was served quickly. I was not served. I asked the waiter a half hour later where my order was. He said it was to come from the kitchen. Almost an hour after arriving we left the cafe minus my order. I think it is very poor service to only serve one member of a party. Both should be served together
"Do not go there, or just for a coffee on the terrace so that you have a nice view.At lunchtime you can not take coffee on the terrace"
"I went to Surtoe with my family, 4 adults and our 2 year old kid.When we sat down, table clothes had big brown stains on them, so did the chair cloths. My flatware was so dirty I don't think it was washed at all after it was used.We've decided we can't eat at such a dirty place and we politely thanked the waitress and said we'll eat somewhere else without complaining. She was so rude and furios, yelled us to go away and don't come back, etc. So I recommend you to stay away from this place. There are so many other nice restaurants in Ghent."
"We arrived here ready for some good authentic Chinese food but we were in for something else. The starters we ordered never came. We didn't even get an appetizer like the other tables did. After 1,5 hours of waiting and being completely ignored by the staff, our main course arrived. It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't worth the wait. Won't be returning."
"Stopped by for Lunch on Friday, December 23rd. It was still early, not many people sitting. We were a party of two. I asked about Fish dishes, the waiter recommended seafood options which I declined, mentioning I do not eat shellfish etc., just fish.I ordered the cod, since there were only two fish to choose from. It was supposed to be Cod fish with grated cheese and mashed potatoes. Once the dish arrived, I put my fork in to uncover the fish and felt something that had, how should I say, a different texture and hardness than fish - it was a shrimp of some sort, or other.. I called the waiter and explained I am allergic to these and therefore can not eat the dish - to which he replied ""it's just one, we add it at the very end""... The shellfish was under the cheese so I'm not that sure about when it was added, but the point is I specifically mentioned I don't eat shellfish, and there is no reason to add one into a cod dish anyways... Bottom line is I was informed that wether I eat it or not - I'll be charged for the dish.I've been to many restaurants, I don't recall ever complaining about my food, but I've seen others return a dish - never have I seen such behavior!I guess ""The Butler"" is in such grave financial trouble that it can't afford to absorb a 15 Euro dish getting tossed to the bin. The manager/owner was the one who made it clear - so I would only say this: There are plenty of beautiful restaurants in Knokke, many of them at the same place as this one, please, do yourselves a favor and try them, stay away from this establishment which I can't speak for their food, but I can testify to their lack of human relations, to their being tight and stingy, on the verge of aggressive and rude. I'll be coming back to beautiful Knokke, but I will never set foot in this disgusting place again."
"The trays that we were served with was unclean that it had a rancid smell to it. Our bread was directly put on it. The table seemed like it was never cleaned with tomato soup smears all over it. The quiche with lamb we had, had sour-ish lamb. The soup was luke-warm and eh. We could barely swallow. I would NOT reccomend it and it is definitely OVER RATED! Avoid it. It's not worth the time and money... "
"We are two families of four, but we're not told when we asked for a table of 8 that they limit groups of 5+ to a maximum of 4 choices. It was only after we had been served drinks and were ordering our meals that we were told this rather imperiously ""it is on the menu"" (in small letters on the back of the long menu). We declared ourselves two parties of four and the waitress made her displeasure obvious. The restaurant was only half full so I'm not sure how they manage during the busy times (or perhaps the staff's rudeness takes care of that eventuality from happening). Also the menu listed apple juice which they don't carry and we were chastised for bringing in some for one of the kids. Had we not been so tired we would have left.As a former waitress myself I understand people can be demanding but really how hard would it have been to have explained the policy in advance?Still waiting for our food to arrive, but will add a review of that aspect should it ever come!"
"My husband and I came to this restaurant one evening as we were staying with some friends in the Wondelgem area. Never have I ever felt more uncomfortable in my life. I am still in shock. We sat inside the premise due to the fact that the terrace area would of been too cold for us. The restaurant owner, Mauro, seemed arrogant and rude for reasons we could not understand. Let me explain, I ate the salmon carpacio which was STILL frozen! My husband had thglioni fiziosi pasta with scampi and salmon which was also cold after waiting for over an hour. We started to get uncomfortable by the way the owner was inappropriately touching his female staff members who were clearly uncomfortable... Finally, we spoke to the owner, Mauro, to express our grief in the politest way possible. We conversed in Italian due to the fact that I had taken Italian courses for over 15 years and I am quite fluent in the language. When we spoke, he made various racial slurs at us which progressed to him constantly attacking our ethnicity. When we told him we didn't want any problems... He then proceeded to laugh at my husbands oxygen mask (which he uses post lung cancer surgery). This review goes beyond just restaurant etiquette - there was clearly a lack of human decency. My husband, who has battled cancer for years now, was completely broken. On lookers witnessed this exchange and proceeded to leave, they came up to us and extended their sympathy vouching to never go back to the establishment. We understand that some people lack self constraint, we hope that the staff of Mauro's will learn from this experience and better themselves as we have learned that some people are in-explicitly and unapologetically cruel. What an absolute horror."
"We were having dinner surrounded by at least 3 mice, running around and under our table and chairs. When confronting the manager, his answer was that it was totally normal in Ghent and that they already knew about it and could do nothing, so if you go there expect to have dinner in company since apparently this is inevitable...We headed directly to the health authority to place a formal complaint and spoke to the police about it. They were alarmed but said they where not surprised it happened in Amadeus so I guess it doesn’t have the best reputation. Disgusting. There where so many mice and moving around so freely we even had time to take a couple of pictures:"
Unbelievably rude and aggressive waiter - wouldn't let us put any tables together to seat a party of 6.  Could have politely explained their policy but just barked at us.  The food may be good but the hospitality stinks
"Rude, unfriendly, and apparently not good food according to local restaurants.. we sat down, then left after 10mins, really unprofessional and a horrid approach to customers."
"The food was not bad but overpriced, but that would have been acceptable. 
The real problem is about the attitude of the of the people working there. Very bad service.
A very painful experience."
"Ordered take away twice, both times found hair in sauce and on pizza. Menu is different than what you get. Capriciosa on the menu is mozzarella, tomato sauce, ham and mushrooms, but it was full of onions. On daughters pizza short black hair. Do not recommend this place"
"Waited over an hour for food, only for them to get our orders wrong, refuse to change them, accuse us of ordering differently to how we did, and bring out “boiled” eggs that were completely raw!! Not only this, but they didn’t apologise at all for the service, and we paid ~20 euros each for the privilege of having our mornings ruined. It doesn’t take an hour to cook eggs and organise premade items on a plate, especially when you’re charging 15 euros for said eggs. Apparently they’re struggling for staff, but we weren’t given any indication that our wait would be longer than normal, or that this was a new place. Highly disappointed."
Don't go there for lunch on a SaturdayThe waiter is totally uninterested in the clients and was even watching videos on his mobile - this was louder than the music playing in the restaurant - then he disappeared and couldn't be found for about 15 minutes. It seems we were the only ones being so stupid to come to the restaurant - nobody else showed while we were there.
From seven people the 5 meat dishes was ok or very good. Past with seafood was deamed ok by our local host but not eatable by the Swedish guest. Food was sent out but still she had to pay for it. It was not possible to split the bill. That is unacceptable in 2015. We will not come back.
"We had lunch in this restaurant and I found it a very irritating and over priced experience. The waiter was Asian and extremely condescending. I asked for the wifi code first and was told none was available as it wasn't ""cool"" to use the phone! Then he told me to move the phone away from the water side of the table in case it fell in. The menu was very expensive but I had the chicken curry. It came but wasn't chicken, but some tough sort of meat. I asked what it was and I was told turkey thigh which was ""more expensive than chicken""-I think not!! It was a medley of vegetables and not very filling or tasty.My companion had a better dish, the sardines, but nothing great either. I ordered a glass of red wine on arrival and it didn't come and when it eventually arrived it was tiny (€4). The waiter made a great big deal out of the desserts and again patronised us by asking us to ""trust him"" in his recommendations. He had no ice cream, just some limoncella sorbet which was very average although he made a big fuss telling us how terrific it was and pointedly asked me if I knew what a sorbet was. The chocolate cake was heavily laced with some sort of kirsch but was ok. The coffee cake was very dry and not good. €76 for a most average meal with the most annoying and extremely slow service. The only upside was that the table was canal side and pretty. Could not recommend this place on any level."
Fantastic service . Great location and the restaurant was clean in appearance . Food tasted amazing until we found a hair in our food
"Friendly people, but the stirfry I ordered was superdry and not very tasty. On the upside, it was supercheap so I guess it's a good price/quality ratio... But I'd rather have a more expensive and tasty dinner."
"Be ready to wait LONG for your food.
We had to wait 75 minutes for our order to get very chewy entrecote and not a word of excuse for waiting or changing the one of the dishes we have ordered. 
Sad..."
"Don't get me wrong, the building is stunning and it has a beautiful atmosphere. But after receiving cold coffee I was less than impressed to receive a cold bowl of soup. I informed the waitress who kindly returned it to the kitchen, only to be handed another cold bowl of soup. Not to mention that the soup was consumed using a dessert spoon. Will not be returning!"
"The Rambler is a typical tourist trap brasserie that gets by because it is one of the few restaurants near the train station.  Surly waiters, terrible service, questionable hygiene.  Stay away!"
"I think the title says it all.  The only upside to this venue is the nice terrace and cosy garden.  As for service, food and comfort... a big zero."
"Too sugary and no vegetables though we both had a vegetarian dish. The tofu was bland and the curry not spiced at all. Overpriced for the food. And there was no toilet paper or paper towels in the toilets. The service was close to rude, but that was really a blessing in disguise: I don't think I would've kept my mouth shut if she'd asked if we'd enjoyed our meal."
"Too many things on the menu look like crap, smell like crap, and taste like crap. I asked for my steak medium-well, but it was frozen in the center. I found a dead cockroach on the floor of my booth. They can survive a nuclear explosion, but the entree was too much for them. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'BEWARE OF DOG (FOOD)!'"
"A truly horrendous experience with the vile owner of this restaurant. My friends and I arrived for lunch and were greeted with ""yes?"". I dared to ask the soup of the day, much to the chagrin of the owner. I asked for a few more minutes to decide, to which he responded, ""I only have one minute"", raising his voice. When we made it clear that we were leaving, he shouted at us in front of other diners and stormed into the restaurant shouting and raising his hands, and ripped the phone that we had been charging from the wall, before gesturing for us to leave. The most unnecessary outburst I've ever experienced at the hands of a man clearly not fit to work in the hospitality industry. Suffice to say that I will NEVER be returning."
"Here is some well-intended advice from a local to all who consider visiting our beautiful city of Ghent. De Witte Leeuw is a - classical textbook - 'tourist trap' restaurant. Shamefully overpriced considering the poor quality of the food they serve, totally relying on the top location. If you come to Ghent, you should definitely visit the Graslei, but if you want to enjoy our delicious Flemish cuisine, go somewhere else!"
"I was at Pampas already several times before, usually it was not so bad, even though it was not really special. But, this time, everything was too bad! You ask for beers and they forget! You ask for desserts and your desserts are not coming to you but to another table and finally there are no more desserts like what you asked! The meat was bad quality, dry. They were serving everything like micro portions! Very small pieces of meat, one by one. You had to stop the waiter to ask for a second or a bigger piece! The potatoes arrived after 1 hour! The vegetarian options, asked for some of my colleagues, was very very bad! NEVER AGAIN"
"It looked like a good place, not so big or so busy. However then we had to wait for an hour for our food until they told us it would be 5 more minutes. It was obvious they had forgotten us. We complained about it that we had almost left and hoped we would get some kind of discount. Our waitress immediately defended herself and said it was busy. When I told that people who arrived later were already eating and some already finished eating 50 sushi, she was quiet. The food finally arrived, but they had forgotten something already and didn't seem to remember the order.After we had finished and wanted to ask the bill she came to us and rudely told us not to look at then like that (she accused us of looking angrily at then the entire time which wasn't true, albeit ofcourse we were not happy about the long wait and lack of any apology). She started to argue. She insisted it was not their fault but ours. In the end she did offer a personal discount while still saying it was not their mistake for forgetting us.Looking back at the reviews I can agree that the staff is not professional and quality of service is lacking. The food is ok but I have had better quality at other places with staff that was also professional, even places where it was 10 times more busy on a new years eve instead of a November evening... Best to avoid this place if you want to have a good evening!"
"I went a first time in the first week after its opening. Fancy interior, good food, friendly service, and not too much frequented yet. So, something to get back to I thought. The second time, the place was busy but we had the luck some people just left, and we took their table. After half an hour, and repeatedly asking, still nobody had come to remove the dirty plates of the previous, let alone to take our order. Fed up we left, thirsty and hungry. A third time, in summertime, we took a seat on the trendy terrace, ordered a fresh orange juice, and got an awful mixture that was probably half water - half juice. For that price, that's called a rip-off. Conclusion: the place wants to be trendy with fancy interior and expensive prices but doesn't deliver. As we say in Flemish: ""willen en niet kunnen""."
Service was bad and the food is not at all authentic Indian food. Either the chef makes food for Western pallet and/or the food is actually terrible. Highly over priced dishes and no value for money. Actual Indian food tastes much better and won't recommend this restaurant even if you were eating Indian/Nepalese food the first time. 
"Bad manners are a deal breaker for me, so not going back.As for the food it was average/poor despite that they charge ~13 Euros per dish... in terms of value for money this is an expensive place, not to mention that you have to stand the mean manager manners. You are better going somewhere elseThe manager overreacted by shouting and moving aggressively when we asked to pay separately. She claimed she couldn't do it.... it's just that she didn't want to do it. The waiters asked her to let us pay separately but still she refused. What a terrible manager!"
"We were with 6 people, but 4 arrived first (1 was a 2 year old child). In an unfriendly way, they put us in a table for 4 (without seat for child) and quickly left, not giving the opportunity to ask for a chair for the child and to explain that there were 2 more coming. After around 10 min they gave the child seat and regarding the bigger table (for the other 2 to arrive) they just said ""we will figure out something"". Meanwhile, no waiter came to ask if we wanted drinks...Around 20 min after that, the other 2 arrived, and nothing had happened regarding the seats and the drinks. After around 5 min that the other 2 were standing up, they joined another table to ours - to make it into 6. Still, no waiter came to ask for drinks or even to give the drinks menu... After around 30 min since our arrival, and being ""invisible"" to the staff, one of us stood up to ask for a wine menu (as a 'tip' to them)... we got the wine menu from the manager (very unfriendly) but still no waiter showed up at our table... About 60 min after we arrived, the waiter came asking if we wanted drinks, we asked for the drink menu (not wine menu) since it was never given to us... But I have to say here that on top of all that the restaurant was not full and the waiters and the Manager were not friendly at all. After all that, we simply got up and left. In the way to the end, I saw the (rude) manager and I started to tell her that we were leaving because we were not well treated by them, but she just didn't let me finish and went to talk to the waiter 5m away from us... It simply does not treat its clients as it should. I will never go back there!"
"5:30pm, restaurant is completely empty with the exception of one couple. However, we are not allowed to sit at the bigger table. For god sake ..having 2 rooms, being able to connect the tables and still....the place is empty (!)we cannot sit comfortably and have a nice Time, we are forced to sit At a tiny, Little table where we can barely fit 1 pizza plate. That's not my idea of spending a nice evening. This place is not customer friendly and i have never been that disappointed. The service was really poor, i still believe that it is all about the customer...The food was not the worst but spending so much Money to be treated that way..never again. We are quickly and left. Waste of Time and Money."
"You have 5 rounds and you can only order 5 items every round each person. For the nigiri, it only comes one as one item. For the cooked mushroom, it comes as a big bowl which you have to finish (or pay extra). For the sashimi, you have to pay 3 euro extra each time. It's doesn't mean ""all you can eat"". Btw, you have to pay 10% service fee. I won't go there again."
"It was the only bad experience we had in this beautiful town. We were treated like criminals, all of the staff was extremely rude for no reason at all it was shocking! The food was mediocre and room we were thrown in was next to the toilet that stank with no decoration at all and extremely uncomfortable. Never again!"
"I think this are one of the worst ribs I have eated. The ribs are dry and you could not get all the meat from the bones.

The baked potato was nice and the service was ok. But remember this chain is all about volume."
"The Zwadderkotmolen is a restaurant I was looking forward to visit. Although it was for a ""party"", we were more or less sure at least the food would be good. Think again!The starter was a real disaster, the (first) soup couldn't be eaten because of the enormous amount of pepper, the second soup tasted like asparagus, although I think the number of asparagus used could be counted on one hand . . . The meat of the main course (porc) was so hard, I almost had to ask for a better knife. And the vegetables? I almost missed them because they were hardly visible. The wines were not brilliant either, and I'm already giving too much credit. The best part was the coffee . . . and, lucky for us, the people at our table.Although we did not have to pay the bill, we were really ashamed of the amount that was charged for the menu. Unless we are invited to go there again, we will not book a table in this restaurant ever again."
"Quite nice food let down by truly awful service. Food took ages, requests were ignored, we were ignored. There was only one serving person who gave anything like a smile or a welcome. To top it all we were told desserts were not being served because the kitchen staff were too busy cooking main courses (no accompanying apology from the Basil Fawlty rude waiter]. Ten minutes later others were being served desserts, so this was just a bare faced lie. We can think of no other reason for us being singled out in this way other than we are not Belgian. It was a bad end to a not very enjoyable meal. Oh, and also I was served the worst tasting Mojito EVER, If you must come here don’t order a cocktail!"
"Very nice location & interior but horrible & unfriendly service. Plates were taken away whilst we were still eating!!! We were so shocked that we didn’t react...The food was very average: fries way too salty & over cooked, beef stew (stoverij) was not worth the name “Belgian stoverij”, ...Whilst we were still drinking our coffees the chef was watching football on a big tv screen... All by all not worth a visit & your money!!!"
"1) you want a nice evening, with welcoming hosts, good hospitality and service? This place has none of the above; in fact, a rude, unwelcoming owner. Perfect setup for a bad evening(2) the place is small, compact and has bad/ claustrophobic ambience(3) if you reach after 21:15 - they are likely to not serve you. It’s not a risk and effort worth taking. (closing timing on Google maps is wrong) (4) you want takeaway? They won’t give takeaway during regular dinner timings (weird!). Ordered a bit too much? They won’t pack your leftovers either (they’d rather let food go waste) (5) You’re in Ghent - if you want a nice evening, you have many better restaurant options (including Indian) with nice view/ street seating and lovely ambience (and a nice breeze in summer!) - this place has none of those, then why risk spoiling your evening in this otherwise lovely town? All in all, whether you’re a local or holidaying, this place is not worth it and save yourself the bad experience I had to go through"
"We ordered food at 19h51. I went to Nepal and i must say. People there are much faster than here. It took them 50 minutes to bring us momo, which were overcooked. There were just 7 tables to be served, not more. Now after an hour and 20 minutes we still have not got our food. We are leaving now.Bad bad bad!"
"On the 20th October 2018, we had dinner at Amadeus in Ghent. To our surprise, we intially saw a mouse running around the dinning room. To our further surprise, there were at least three more!!! We spoke to the manager and according to him, this is something normal and it happens quite often. He argues that it is not his problem and he has nothing to do (at least calling plague control could be an option...). Also, it looks like there are no complaint forms at the place and they offer no solution at all.Consider this when chosing your place for dinner.... Personally, I will deal with this issue in more depth with health inspection and other authorities, but definitely I would recommend you not to go there.Find some pictures below so you can check it for yourselves."
"Ate here for a friends birthday. The food was great. Tried to eat here again last night, and received some of the rudest, most unfriendly service.We made a reservation for 4 people... When we arrived at the restaurant they said we had reserved for 2 and said if we wanted to eat there, 2 people would need to eat at another restaurant. I said it was their mistake and expected a solution. They asked how do I know. I said "" 3 people were listening when the reservation was made."" The hostess said she didn't care they still had no place..If you're looking for good food... A great place, if you're looking for good food, a warm atmosphere and good service - go someplace else .."
"We stayed in the Monasterium a few years ago and the room was very basic. However the location was good so we booked again but paid extra for a ‘superior’ room. The room we were given was terrible, very bare, smelly and had mould in the bathroom. (See photos)We had booked a double bed but were given twins. The room was not as described or photographed on the hotel website.We complained to the lady on reception who was quite adamant that we had a superior room. (She was quite aggressive) and when we showed her the photos of the superior room on their website she said photos don’t always tell the truth! We asked to be moved but she told us the hotel was fully booked. We asked her to come to our room to look at the mould which she said she couldn’t do anything about. She agreed that there was a smell and got a maintenance man to sort it out. When we asked why we didn’t have a double bed she told us that there was only 1 double in the whole hotel!She eventually agreed that we could move as she had miraculously found a vacant room on her system.The room we were eventually given was the superior room that was advertised on the website..with a double bed. We were very happy with the room and enjoyed our stay but our original room would not be acceptable to anyone. It would also appear to be the room that was adapted for people with a disability which doesn’t say much for the way a disabled guest would be treated.We won’t be returning."
"Let there be no mistake, I have lived in 3 different countries, been eating Chinees for 30 years and this is the worst Chinees I have ever eaten. They do only take away, but for the price you can better go and sit down in a decent Chinees restaurant. We had it delivered home, the guy bringing was not Asian, so now I am even no sure that there in a Chinees in the kitchen (on that can cook anyway)!!!! This is a rip-off."
"For not get served for 15mins after entry , the guys just kept ignoring us , I believe because we where all of mixed ethnicities. We said excuse me and he just shrug at as so we left."
Horrible restaurant .Rude and uncurteous staff. The food was BAD and over priced. We were with our seven month old baby and the staff was curt and highly rude. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
"Cool place but don't go there for lunch! The vegetarian dish contained a massive amount of mashed potatoes and bulgur, topped with a few mushrooms and carrot slices."
"We had lunch, and I can't recommend this restaurant. We chose one menu and one ""a la carte"". The cheese croquettes from the list are delicious, and the soup of the day, too.We asked for pork ribs, and they were scorched. Not so very good. The pizza is vast but not tasty. I ordered a vegetarian pizza, a base with tomato, cheese and onion, courgette and red pepper. Nothing unusual. Nothing to relation with an Italian pizza.The service is prolonged. We have waited for at least 40 minutes for the main course. We requested two bottles of water, and the waiter needed 15 minutes to bring us.Don't stop here! There are other restaurants in Gand."
"I ate in this place twice with my classmates on a school trip, the waitress were kind, but the place was quite dirty  and the food was terrible, we're italian and we can not accept to name this food."
"While on holiday in Ghent with my husband and young daughter, we were keen to try Restaurant de Graslei. Sadly we had an appalling experience when we tried to go for lunch - 10/06/15. The young lady who suggested a table to us seemed (at best) lacking any interest in our custom, and with some reluctance did say she would bring a high chair. After sitting for a while with our daughter still in her pram becoming increasingly restless and hungry, we were thrust a single menu by another member of staff. We looked around and saw the first waitress nearby, chatting to other staff and clearing tables, and we wondered if perhaps she may have been busy and forgotten. Unable to attract the attention of the first waitress, my husband politely asked a more senior member of staff about the high chair and the response was so abrupt, rude and dismissive we were left shocked; without even making eye contact she sneered ""if she said she'll get you a high chair you'll get your high chair"".Yes, maybe there are good reviews about the food here, but the service is beyond sub-standard, it is frankly embarrassing.My husband and I have travelled to many different countries and I very rarely leave negative reviews; I have never before felt the need to leave a restaurant due to bad manners by the staff-for that Restaurant de Graslei, you are a first. "
"Winter style cooking in the middle of the summer. Not using season vegetables. Fish was over cooked and hard, meat was dry (pork) and too hard to eat. The bill on the other hand was expensive. Nice location, beautiful outside, but the food was a bad experience."
"The food tasted ok, but it was very little. Does not match the price at all. It also really smells like sewer in here. Worst experience in Ghent so far."
"Ok... Not much to say except for what a terrible place. Service? The owner must be a stingy and greedy person. We wanted to have some drinks, snaks and deserts... They told us ""only guests who order food are allowed to stay"".. and that they ""are afraid that the owner will see guest not eating there and lash on the staff"". Well, they lost our business and we found a real Belgian place not that far from this one.And the owner should think moreif he/she should change to something else."
"I can't believe that I went into this restaurant, but it shouldn't have been this bad. The food was really poor, the service was without charm and there wine list was Red or White. I just can't find any good points about this restaurant and it should be avoided."
"interior and patio are very well designed and have a very coo vibe. the food however was terrible. My daughter a vegan was very excited to try the vegan Stoofvlees (Flemish stew) is way terrible, basically couldn't eat any of it. when the waiter took it away he said, ""was it very tough?""...so I guess this isn't uncommon. I had the veggie penne. very bland, and I'm not sure there we any actual veggies in it. just a think crème sauce. expensive and bed...which is a terrible combo.on the plus side, many folks there were just having drinks in the couch area and they seemed very happy. I recommend if you come here have drinks and stay away from the food."
"Few weeks back we were there to celbrate a birthday of my whife with the family, aperitief, wine, pizza coffe and degustive. I guess 12 people (4 kids) about 350-400 euro, so ok i would say as 3 hours income for them. But strange service...(i thought)Now we we came back (for another birthday) and was imidiately told we have to order a full menu. (Also the kids). Since the owner cancelled reservations to get us a table? Strange planning I thought since there were at least 4 tables free throughout the evening? Well some ordered the menue but not all. Personally i never take dessert and also not coffee so why should I. There was a mix up with the ordering and wrong dishes were served, the owner argued for 10 minutes and got very angry, to tell us we ordered wrong!! So all in all, kind fun evening but not in the udual way... Last time for all of us I guess... And the worst thing of all, went to tripadvisor to find the adress before going there. I tried to write a review the day after, but it was taken off the site. Now a week later back on line... Thats really smart, 'bad evening off-line' then hope the customer forgets! But I didn't."
"Nice looking restaurant, initial thoughts on girl serving was she was quite miserable and unwelcoming. I ordered chicken on lava stone with baked potato and salad. What I got was a cold baked potato and raw chicken breasts on a hot stone. I’ve never seen chicken served raw “for you to cook yourself” anywhere. I asked them to take it back and cook it, they seemed oblivious to the cross contamination dangers of raw chicken. Meal was lovely once cooked and we were not charged for mine. However I am unsure whether this is because I returned it or due to the shard of plastic I found in my meal. Wouldn’t go back "
"First of all an arrogance out of the ordinary, You feel like a beggar, just by asking for a table for dinner, this place is full of frustrated people and without education. 18h open and with a menu that offers fresh salmon and other seafood dishes, all the suggestions were already finished when ordering at 6:00 p.m. and the restaurant was 80 percent empty, in addition they induced you to ask what is best for them. ! There is no freedom of choice, another of the things that can not be overlooked was the bad education of the blonde waitress is out of context. If you do not want to suffer a collapse do not waste your time in this restaurant, the city of Ghent offers other restaurants with an optimum quality of typical foods of the region, biological products and the best of all the service, yes sir."
"The friendly reception and table allocation hides an arrogant style of service. After short you just feel like a number, a tourist among others who has been trapped! Food is medium to low quality, and you need a huge portion of patience as waiting time between starter and main course easily overpasses a full hour!Tables are very close and finally nothing is really better here than just to accept to get a portion of deception for a high price."
"We reserved a table for 09:00, i even asked at the phone if it was too late and they told me it was not a problem since the kitchen would close at 10:30 and the restaurant at 11:00. Throughout the all dinner the waiter keep on coming at us to tell us the kitchen would close at 10:30, the personell from the kitchen stared at us the all time and they even started sweeping and washing the floor in front of our table. We could not even be relaxed knowing they were staring at us and waiting for us too leave. Apart from the rude service, there is not that much of food choice or quality. Very few types of rolls, low food/price ratio. For 25 euros I would go somewhere else in Gent."
"We came here for a lunch because the reviews seemed quite alright. There seemed to be nice fixed price lunch menu, but 45 minutes after our order they came in our order was lost and all 10 of us had to order again. This is usually not a big deal, since a regular restaurant offers a free coffee or a small discount in return, but not at De Graslei. A few moments later I ordered a second beer, but also that one didn't arrive before asking again after 20 minutes.The service didn't seem to enjoy their work, 2 of our steaks were overcooked, ""het vispannetje"" was more of a russian style cheese bomb and the chicken filet was dry. Belgians might like this place, but we recommend to find another place to enjoy a meal."
"We were served by the chef himself, but he was a real jerk. From the first encounter. And for god knows what reason!? He should stay in his kitchen. Wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy."
"Was just here tonight and ordered calamari which were rotten. Asked the waiter to take them back and we were so put off and we decided to leave. They tried to charge for the rotten calamari, shocking service from the manager, rude and unprofessional. This place doesn't deserve any rating "
" We went there on Christmas Eve for a warm meal and drinks. We ordered for two starters and a main course since we could only have that much. After finishing the meal we couldn't finish one of the mains and asked for a take away. When the bill arrived, we were told we've been billed for 2 mains instead of the starter. We politely asked if there was a miscommunication as we had clearly pointed out in the menu what we wanted. The answer was - be thankful we did take away for you and that it was our problem we didn't check with them as to whether main portion or a starter portion was server.We paid the bill threw the takeaway in their face and left in disgust. Ruined the entire evening. "
The owner charges 6 euros! for a cheap beer or a soda served in a very dirty glass. His place is extremely unhygienic. Stay away!
"Came pretty highly rated, but did not live up to expectations. We were seated and served drinks quickly, but for a restaurant that SPECIALIZES IN RIBS they had our modestly-sized group waiting for OVER AN HOUR for our ribs.

Not very impressive."
"We had to wait about two hours before we got the food.
We had Chicken Tikka Masala but it was Absolutely tasteless, and the sauce was thin as water. Neither the chicken or the sauce had any taste, and the Rice was sticky."
"We were 8 persons having dinner in this restaurant. All of us agreed that the food was horrible. We had ribs, chicken, steak salad...so almost everything  in the menu. None of them were at least decent.  Do not recommend this restaurant."
"Great location in the heart of Ghent, but what a disappointing experience! Very slow service, meat came overcooked for 3 of our family members (asked 'saignant'/rare but got well done), mussles for 2 of our party came undercooked, half of them not open... Very disappointing!Tablea not cleared for more than 45 minutes although the restaurant was not full... Even a tourist trap deserves better!"
"This place is significantly mismanaged If you are looking for a reasonable speedy lunch go elsewhere We were seated and ordered our drinks They sat on the bar for a while until one of the waitresses realised there is a tray of drinks which needs to be served. Then ordered our pizza and waited 1,5 hours!!! to get just one pizza We thought the other one would follow quickly but nothing Instead 3 other tables received only 1 pizza each So I started to eat my pizza while my partner sat there watching me waiting for his After I finished mine we complained (again) and his pizza finally arrived missing some of the extra toppings asked for. Same as other tables around us There was also a woman with her child waiting 45 minutes for ice cream Ridiculously mismanaged place No idea how they stay in business They have no clue what they are doing in the kitchen and not cooking table after table but obviously rolling the dice which dish to cook next"
"Based on a previous positive experience, we reserved an outdoor table at Het Genot op den Berg for an intimate family reunion in the summer. From the moment we were seated, we felt we were not welcome. The waitress took the menu out of the hand of one of our guests with some force. The bottle of wine we had ordered to be served as cocktail was not coming until we reminded the waiter several times. Of the 4 bottles we ordered, one we sent back because the wine had oxidized. Instead of graciously accepting, the waiter argued. The glass of one of our guests was not refilled like the other guests. We inquired about a selection between two appetizers, but were told off that the menu prix-fix with 3 courses could not be changed and if we wanted the other appetizer instead, which several of our guests wanted, they would have to take the 4-course menu prix-fix, which they didn't want. In the end, the waiter allowed us to change because the chef didn't object. In addition, the food was ordinary. Never before have we paid so much for ordinary food and bad service."
"Walked in sat down @ 4pm to be told that as I hadn’t reserved could stay for 30mins or sit outside under a heater. Many free tables and when looked online I could book for 4.30pm. Not impressed hence the score , and didn’t even get to eat or drink anything off the dog eared laminated menus."
"We went to the restaurant wanting to eat and the waiter was extremely rude to us. We asked him in english about the menu. Instead of just saying that the kitchen is closed he started to speak to us very loudly and rudely: ""It is cerrado! The kitchen is cerrado!"". I am Brazilian and I am presume that because of my latino appearance he didn't believe I could speak in English with him. We were quite shocked as you can imagine. For me, that is obviously a racist attitude; I recommend you to avoid it, especially if you are not Flemish!"
"The prices were okay and the inside looks alright. However, you get dictated where to sit depending on what you are eating (booths for anyone who wasn't ordering pasta) and my friend almost got asked to leave because she didn't want a drink with her meal (The lady told us she has to order a drink, and rolled her eyes and cursed when my friend said she didn't want one). They spoke little English, however was lovely to anyone who spoke French (yet cold, rude and impatient to anyone who speaks English). My pizza wasn't even cut for me, and my friends had to steal knives and forks from the other tables because the host didn't want to offer them a set. They got my friends order wrong. I felt like they didn't even want us to eat there at all, or at least not enjoy our experience eating there. Please do not go to this resteraunt!"
"We were very much looking forward to our evening here, but I write at 21.57 while wait for our main course having arrived a little after 20.30. Total & utter shambles. So so poor. Go elsewhere."
"On the evening we went the café was very busy but the excellent staff soon had our order taken and our drinks brought to the table. It was not long before our food arrived. This prompt arrival was due to the fact that both our dishes were cold dishes (other than the fries). Both dishes were very poor indeed. My wife’s dish had been taken straight out of the refrigerator and not given any time to come up to room temperature. I had chosen the traditional tomato stuffed with shrimps. While the tomato and shrimps were satisfactory the accompanying salad was miserable. It consisted of run of the mill lettuce, raw onion, green beans and a boiled egg. What made it even worse was that it was doused in an oil which, being charitable, could be best described as uninviting.At least we did not have to wait long for our food. The two tables next to ours had already placed their orders and got their drinks before we even sat down. One table received their hot dishes just as we were finishing ours and the adjacent table received theirs just as we were leaving."
"We had pizza and a pasta pesto. pizza was ok, but nothing special and the pasta pesto was small and very basic. It was advertised as ""with mushrooms"" but only a half mushroom was found on top of it. The prices let you expect more, as they are very high compared to similar places in Ghent.Service was terrible and it seems that the personnel was divided in different groups, that are not working together but more against each other.And the choice was very limited (3 pizza, 2 pasta). Maybe this was due to the ""Gentse Feesten"", but even than they manage to switch orders and serve cold pasta. This was our first and last visit to this place.In short, to little choice, to expensive, not friendly and cold food."
"The service was very poor.  While I was there, an elderly customer paid for his meal then was refused the use of the toilet.  There are far more friendly and customer-focused places to eat in Ghent than this place."
"This restaurant is a complete ripoff.
The food is absolutely gross and the people that work there are unfriendly and unprofessional. 
To be honest I never ate that bad in a restaurant!"
"Probably a good bar, but we had the unpleasant experience of being waited on by the rudest waiter I have had the displeasure of meeting."
"came in with a group of 4, we were rushed quickly to a table by rude waiters. they wanted our orders quickly and the ribs ended up being pretty mediocre tasting, one of our group got pretty sick later, woke up in the middle of the night having to throw up. i would definitely stay away, there are many other good places to eat in Gent"
The opening hours on Mon are 12:00 to 20:30. At 14:00 they were closed and we have been told the kitchen closes at 13:30I bet the other opening hours are wrong too. Too bad. 
"Nice location. Poor service (actually no service), place is dirty and the quality of the food poor. Could not ruin a nice beer however!!"
"I ordered a large bowl. When I saw how much rice they put in, I thought ""come on, rice isn't that expensive..."" I was still starving after eating it. It was like the staff had received special instructions to make very small portions. Never go there!"
"Beautiful place nice food, terrible service. We ware waiting around 20 minutes for the menu and more 20 for the food come. Not friendly waiter. When we asked for a another cup of coffee she told us: I’m busy and you need wait long time."
"Shall I start with its name? Salt and Pepper. Is this the only Indian restaurant in the world whose food actually requires vast amounts of salt and pepper to disguise its taste? Essentially, this establishment if fraudulent. Firstly, it barely has the right to call its food Indian, let alone describe it as ""Muglai"". How is it Muglai cuisine? Did the Princes of the Mughal Empire insist that their Imperial chefs stuck great clumps of MSG in the pakora starters (as was the case with mine)? And did they ask their Imperial chefs to chuck sugar into their main courses - like mine - whose sauce, by the way, had split and was gritty. All that, stale papad and (unasked for) nan bore no relation to any Indian dish I have ever had (and I have eaten in many parts of India). Secondly, the door, the menus, the bill wallet... were all emblazoned with American Express logos (one of the reasons I walked in). But, hey, they don't take Amex (""that was a previous restaurant""). Thirdly the ""service"". Apart from being disgracefully slow (55 minutes between my first and second course) it is vacant, uncaring and escalating to behaviour befitting a graduate from the Pol Pot School of Charm. When I raised the above issues I was virtually pushed out through the door. This disgusting, cold, dead-at-the-centre eating place can boast lavatories that do not have locks on them, and a wine list offering nothing but ""house"" that tasted as though it had been fermented in a disused Greek swimming pool, In short, it should be investigated by the Belgian authorities (not least over the issue of the fraudulence use of the Amex logos). Had I been a food inspector I would have closed it down on the spot. A disgrace to Ghent. And a disgrace to Indian cuisine. Avoid avoid avoid if it is still open when you read this."
"The panda on the sign looked sad, as we were when we came out of the restaurant. The food was like if the sad panda poopood in our plates. And we did too the day after, so stay away."
"It took ages to get the attention of the waitress and when she finally did take our order we had stuff missing so we then had to chase her yet again. We still didn’t get all that we ordered. Very mediocre food and miserable staff. We were there on Sunday 27th May. It made what was supposed to be a light hearted meal into something quite miserable. It then took ages to pay the bill. If I’d been on my own I would have refused to pay.Very miserable staff, clueless about hospitality and even smiling."
"4 of us were here around 1500 Sunday 2 Aug. The regular staff who all hate working here, sit inside, chatting around a table. The only staff member serving tables outside, is a young boy on his first day at work. Nice but absolutely useless. Took 30min to take our order and another 45 min and 3 reminders later we walked away without getting even the water. Let alone the wine or coffee or food we ordered. It must be a Sunday thing... ?"
"I ordered chicken curry that wasn’t tasty at all and not worth the price at all. I first received a cold rice that then was replaced by a warmer bowl making me wonder if it was heated or fresh and couldn’t really enjoy eating it. Service was good, however; it wasn’t pleasurable to heat the shoutings noises coming from the kitchen. "
"The place wasn't even at half capacity but waiting time for a simple coffee and breakfast/lunch was more than 50 minutes. Pancakes were ordered but they weren't able to serve them, only they forgot to mention it. Avoid at all costs, make sure to make a reservation at Gust accross the street"
my friend and I came to have a lunch before catching a ferry home ...our lunch was ruined by the most awful woman who was the waitress ....she was rude and angry and reluctant to serve with any kind of charm even though we tried our best to be as polite as possible ...this was such a shame as the food was extremely good I see below there are many reviews with the same sentiment ...clearly the waitress has to go !
"When I eat out and choose thai (which isn't very often) I usually go to South East Asia Wok across the street from De Orchidee. On Sunday evenings that restaurant is closed, so we went to De Orchidee. When I got my plate I saw a tiny bug crawling on it... I didn't know quite what to do and got a disgusted look on my face. By the time the waitress asked if something was wrong I had just removed the bug as it was heading towards the sauce and I didn't want it so get stuck in there. I said there was a bug on my plate and that I had removed it. The waitress wandered off. I was tired and hungry so I started to eat, not wholeheartedly, inspecting every singly spickle. A while later a second tiny bug came crawling on my plate. By that time I had lost my apetite completely and shoved the bug into the sauce... I have never heard any such thing before happening at De Orchidee, but it did happen to me and I can tell you: I am never setting foot in that place again!"
"My wife and I had a dinner Osteria Delicati at the beginning of September this year. We ordered spaghetti carbonara among others. What we got looked like spaghetti with mushrooms. It tasted disgusting. We complained about the quality of the food. Unfortunately, instead of accepting our complaint, the waitress began to convince us that it was its normal carbonara with crispy bacon. This crispy bacon was charred and black in color."
"At a gob smacking cost of 35 Euros we had 2x scrambled eggs (came in a soup plate, looked like porridge, was undercooked and frankly inedible - ‘the eggs are from a tin’ the waitress told us later), standard bland bread, a couple of slices of avocado, one orange juice and one not particularly good coffee.Needless to say we will never have breakfast at Le pain quotidien again.PS. According to fore mentioned waitress, complaints about the eggs have been numerous, but when passed on to head office, management doesn’t seem to care at all."
"Tough tough ribs load of rubbish ....avoid
Rather a tourist trap...building Rather nice that's the only positive"
The server said we have to get a drink to have a meal here. The restaurant is full of advertisements. We are not locals and felt uncomfortable. Do not come.
"extremely overpriced for what u get with extra charge for eating there radiculous, not tasty at all you can buy better in the supermarket 3 times cheaper, and what is this eco branding worse if one if the packed meals we took had 10 E nrs? Just skip this place!"
"For a piece of bread we needed to wait 40 mins with an almost empty place. On top of that the bread was hard, ingredients were cold. Definitely not coming back. I would never suggest it."
"We had to wait at about two hours before the first meal was served. All in all it took four hours to finish a 3 course meal. The waiter was incredible rude, insulting guests without any reason. The food was not worth the money either. I would definitely not go there ever again. Probably my worst restaurant experience ever."
Been to this restaurant many times but the last time we went was terrible. The meat was cold inside and not cooked to our liking. Presentation of the starter was terrible. Both my husband and I got stomach upset the next day. The service was unfriendly. Considering the prices for the food this is not acceptable. Shame that they cannot keep the good quality they used to have. We probably will not return.
"Came pretty highly rated, but did not live up to expectations. We were seated and served drinks quickly, but for a restaurant that SPECIALIZES IN RIBS they had our modestly-sized group waiting for OVER AN HOUR for our ribs.

Not very impressive."
"After a splendid dinner last night my wife and I invited my sister-in-law and our nephew and niece for what we hoped to be a pleasant and simple luch today. As I wanted fish we looked-up on internet and found this address nearby. The menu is simple, not cheap, not expensive neither.Two of us ordered the pasta of the house which came slightly overdone but fairly tasty, two other a simple spaghetti bolognese, which turned-out to be not spectacular and I ordered myself 22€ rolls of sole fish.That was terrible. Fish was dry with absolutely no flavor and sauce was right out of the can, poor quality and way too sweet. The fish was so tasteless that I even doubt it was sole. I ate 1/4 of it and had my wife taste it to confirm.As I was paying, I indicated my disappointment to the waitress who could only mention that she had eaten it the day before and that it was fine and that they serve it to lots of customers who are satisfied. Good for them all, but my plate was terrible, my complaint was completely ignored and I was left feeling I have poor taste.As it happens I am a reasonably good cook, fish sole myself out of the sea and would know how to prepare a decent sauce to go with. I also have the pleasure to visit the table of some of the world finest restaurants. After enjoying l'Oustaou de Beaumanière, a 1-star Michelin in Les-Baux-de-Provence recently, we will be having dinner at the Slagmolen, a two-star Michelin in Opglabbeek next weekend. They have a lot more consideration for their customers.Last but not least, if you nonetheless decide to go at 't Vrijdagsgevoel, visit the bathroom, you will enjoy the sight of their vacuum cleaner resting on the tabletop. On the way up you'll notice power sockets coming out of the wall and on a table on the second floor you'll have access to the bookkeeping of the owner who leaves it's documents for you to inspect at will."
"This is a restaurant in one of the most emblematic street of Ghent, the service is terrible, you have many waiters and everyone is talking without taking into account that all the people are not tourists who pass and do not return, there are also local people from Ghent like we are. A bad service is a bad reference for the place! I do not recommend it. You have to wait between 45 minutes and 1 hour to pay the bill."
"The food has no flavour and was very dry,  i havent like it at all.  

We  order pasta carbonara and fish sticks,  the pasta was the worst pasta i've ever eaten , the sticks werent so bad but i would never repeat."
My family and I waited in this restaurant for 20 minutes without even having a drinks order taken. It was especially strange as the waitress came up twice and said she'd take our order as soon as we were ready only to walk off immediately despite the fact we said we were ready. As she walked past us for the fourth time ignoring us I said we were leaving and she didn't seem remotely bothered. I appreciate it's a busy and very touristy restaurant but to leave a family especially with two small children waiting that long is not acceptable. Her rude offhand manner as we left just confirmed the utter distain she felt for her customers. I also tried to catch the attention of other waiting staff during this time only to be equally ignored. I would certainly not recommend this restaurant. 
On a busy saterday afternoon we found two people overhere. And the reason became clear when we got our food. The tagliatelle salmon smelled sour and tasted absolutely not fresh. Also the service was very poor. We had to wait 10 minutes before we received the bill and could pay by debit.
"We were sitting at the terrace at 17h30 with friends and our baby. Other people come to sit after us and were served first. When the waiter asked us what we wanted (it was then 17h45), she told us we could not have drinks because the restaurant opened at 18h. I told her we were going to have to small finger food with the drinks and still she said it was not possible. We left after this discussion and went next door. Next door: friendly staff who asked us to sit inside where it was warm, where we could have our drinks and feed our baby"
"Cheap nasty food, €10 for a bottle of water, pure con. Even split the water over us and didn’t say sorry"
"Came with 4 friends, the staff was very rude and disrespectful. Food was okay flavor wise but served cold. Will not go back."
If you would like to be fed worse than ready meals and dorittos off a bag please try this place. The waitress was awful as well at explaining any of the non-english menu items. We used google translate for most things. There was better food in the christmas market across the square! 
"Rude service, additional charges for payment with card. Food was not better than anything else nearby."
"This restaurant has had several incarnations over the past few years. There are splendid views across the river towards the old city from both the terraced area and interior. The dishes we ate were examples of fusion cooking. However as often happens with this style of cooking,in my view, had lead to confusion. A well cooked seabass was spoilt by a muddled mixture of waterzooi and Asian vegetables. The Ladies toilets were a disgrace, one had a lock broken and another with the seat on the floor. Will not return."
"The food looked good, but, we have been waiting for 1 hour for our order. They had an issue with the kitchen, and they keep us waiting there without saying anything about it. We were so disappointed, and they also gave us the bill for our drink. Unprofessional service. 1 star experience today."
"Waiting for a salad and a steak for more than hour, absolutely no bread/nuts/whatever to go with your drinks while you wait. 
Slow and unprofessional service."
"What was supposed to be a great evening with nice asian food and family turned out to be probably my worst restaurant experience so far. The dishes that were ordered came in random order, you’d get rice 20 minutes before the meat came so it would be cold by then. Staff simply couldn’t follow. Some dishes looked nothing like the photo’s on the menu, some meats were cold by the time they made it to our table, some were undercooked. As of our 2nd round of orders there was a gas flavor in all of the plates. We sent some stuff back because of that but never got anything in return or not even a reaction or explanation. When the strange gas-flavored food started working on my internal you know what, the experience got even worse when visiting the toilets, but at the same time it told so much about the quality of this place and how it’s being looked after. Both urinals were broken and overflowing with urine, there was urine all over the floor, the sink was dirty... I think the owner of this place has a LOT of work to improve things. Anyway, they will never ever see me there again. "
Terrible experience. Food average at best. Understaffed and poor waiting staff. Water is almost 10 euros!! Do not go.
"Ordered calamares: soggy with fat, calamares extremely small and close to plastic. We gave back after each of us tasting one. It nevertheless appeared on the bill, the incredibly impertinent waiter explained to us: what you order, you pay for. If you do not like, it has to do with your palate. No, it only had to do with delivering poor quality! In this place they have completely forgotten that there only reason of existence is serving the client in a proper way. Do not go here, Ghent has to offer a lot, a lot better!"
We were excited to visit this place to enjoy some nice Belgium beer. Unfortunately when we arrived we were met wit an unfriendly waitress behind the bar who ignored us for 10 minutes and then told us in a rude manner that if we wanted service to sit at a table.
"We attended here as 8 people part of aBirthday dinner. The service was absolutely appalling and the staff so rude. They wouldn’t give ice as it was for cocktails and for clients only and charged us €4 for a bottle of tap water which tasted horrible. A number of us ordered duck and it was so tough it tasted like beef and the beef was like leather. I would not recommend this restaurant absolutely appalling, tasteless and service and attitude so bad. Avoid this place!"
First of all their Home Made Ice Tea is very watery and has no flavor.We waited 60 minutes for our food and it wasn’t even a busy day. The burgers weren’t even that great 
"Not an experience i'd recommend to anybody. Highly priced food for a poor service.
Despite the cosy atmosphere and convenient location, it's a ""no way"".
Better restaurants around."
"After some negative experiences, we gave it another chance, as we'd heard about a new management. Not much has changed for the better, though. Just ordering a few beers on the terrace was daunting. Dirty, wobbly table, slow service, and when we made a remark, we got a rude, arrogant reply of the waiter. Courtesy?"
"Longed for to go here. We arrived half an hour before the kitchen closed. The counter to the kitchen was full, which is of course a good sign. Table of four and one of two free at the window. In principle, this is kept free for people who are less mobile, which I can appreciate. However, half an hour before closing time, cramming a customer who comes alone to eat in a narrow corridor with a counter aimed at a wall where the broth smell of days lingers I can only moderately appreciate. Which I also shared in a literal sense. To then suggest takeaway with a smile. I thought I would come here for the experience. Not so. In Japan, eating alone is perfectly normal. Here, apparently, you are a pariah. Just an apology for the rudeness would have sufficed."
"It's touristy, fine, I'm a tourist-but the dish I ordered, a chicken stew, was cream-based (although the menu didn't mention that) and scalded. It was not really edible. There are other restaurants around with views just as good if not better, and with good food. Neptune is an example."
"This is the ONLY case in my life where I walked out from a restaurant offended. Awful service!!!!We walked all day with my partner and were very tired. We wanted to drink a coffee to gain some energy and then decide which pizza to order.Once we ordered the two coffees the “waitress” (that person doesn’t deserve to be called a waitress, as there is NO humanity or customer service skills in her) made a sour face. Annoyed went to ask the “boss” if it’s possible for us to order only coffee. She came back with some attitude saying “you can’t order just drinks, THIS IS A RESTAURANT, E? I mean, what “E” even means?!By the way, once we set to the table I realised we set to a table next to a socket where I wanted to put my charger. The owner or manager (whatever that rude, disgusting person is) said “you can’t use it, FIRST YOU HAVE TO PAY” :OIf the service at this place could be measured, they would get 0 point or even minus!!!Disrespectful!!! Awful people at it’s “finest”."
You have a saloon of empty tables and tables with 5 seats occupied by 1 person and you send a solo tourist away? Shame on you
"Don't bother. The waitress has a tattoo with ""don't judge me"" and we assume this reflects her complete incompetence! Asking for bread four times, only to get it when finished, sub-standard food, slow service, forgetting a main meal completely and us having to prop up the rocky table with the menu ourselves plus grab our own napkins and cutlery!!! An experience to forget... Ghent is lovely. This place not!"
We were walking by and saw they have a very good Irish coffee so we decided to come in. We were told that we could not just come in for one drink it was not allowed. The person was rude telling us this and said it was their policy. Too bad since we thought it would be a nice place to come back another night to eat. 
"We ordered egg rolls (loempia) and dim sum. The loempia was fried and smelled weird had no filling, the dim sum was overcooked. Never again."
"Went there with a party of 10, well announced the number of people on beforehand, upon ordering we did our best to order a much as possible the same dishes, but service went completly haywire, some food was completly forgotten , and when complaining Managment went APESHIT..... very unprofessional, hope it has been only a one off"
"Quite empty inside but wanted to give it a try anyway. Unfortunately it was not a good experience. Too few toppings on the pizza and too salty and too fat.
The owner was unfriendly and doesn't speak the local language.
I do not recommend."
"I was in with a couple of friends and the first incident happened when I wanted to use the bathroom. I made my way to the bathroom passing in between some empty tables, when a staff member ( a black man)standing next to the bar shouted hoi,hoi and signaled with his arms in the air that I should pass the other way. But the worst was to come!! When my friend wanted to pay with her credit card she was told that that was only possible for amounts over 25€. She was commenting this with us when the same member of staff came over declaring that this was the same everywhere in Belgium. I corrected him, because I am Belgium and this is absolutely not right. Than he became really really unpleasant telling me several times that it was my problem.I will never be back and really hope that this man is not allowed to keep offending visitors to our beautiful city there or anywhere else."
"We went to this restaurant last Thursday as a result of all the good reviews we read on Tripadvisor and in our guide and I have to say we were hugely disappointed. We ordered some steaks with chips and we told the waitress specifically that one of them couldn't have anything else but the meat and salt as one of us was allergic to black pepper. It took them almost an hour to cook the steaks and when they brought them, they all had pepper on them. We told the waitress about it and she took it back very rudely. After this, it took them another 40 minutes to prepare a second steak. In the meantime, our waitress made sure to tell all the other members of the staff about the problem she had with us, which made us feel very uncomfortable. Leaving this problem aside, the quality of the food was average (the steaks were overcooked) and the prices were quite high. The only thing to stand out would be that the building, which is quite unique and very well decorated. Overall, two hours wasted in Ghent, especially if you go there for a day trip from Brussels."
"Looks and feels like a great place, but the owner is a real crook as there is no price list.
The beers are way overpriced, 6 euro's for a beer that's worth 2,5 - 3€ in another pub.  
Really disappointing!!!"
"We came here to have dinner and watch a football match. We were let down by the food and service. When we arrived we asked for nachos but the waitress said that we should wait 20 minutes to order. When are nachos arrived they were made with Doritos and smothered in canned sauce. The hamburgers were undercooked and cold. The experience was made worse by the bar's insistence to leave the front door open and let in the cold air because the workers said that they were hot. When we asked to close the door, they insisted on keeping it open. We moved tables and that helped somewhat. I will not return."
"Our hotel front desk staff recommended this joint when we asked for a recommendation for an Italian restaurant. It was about a 20 minute walk from the old town cathedral district so that was a plus. But the food...... We both ordered spaghetti carbonara that was the worst example of that traditional Italian dish we have EVER eaten. The ""speck"" or ham was no meat and all fat. There was virtually no cream/cheese sauce on the pasta and the bottom of the bowl was full of what looked like skim milk (it wasn't but that is the best description). We asked the ""waiter"" about the poor quality ham and we were told that there was suppose to be fat on it for taste and if we didn't believe him, we could look it up on the internet. I did and now he can look up this review on Trip Advisor. 14.50 Euros for an order of flour and water (the spaghetti) and speck with nothing but fat and some kind of sauce that might have been made from skim milk and powdered Kraft parmesan cheese is outrageous."
We order 4 Irish Coffee and 1 ice cream for my son and once the waiter brought the drinks i told him about the Irish Coffee that the coffee and the cream was mixed and looking awful and he respond me it is what it is!!!!After tasting the coffee it was just wisky that was thrown into a glass of coffee!!Then i went to pay the bill at the bar and told him about the Irish Coffee and he respond me that i was not pollite !!! Can you imagine even after paying 38 euro for a bad Irish he even insult me!!So i can recommend the people to never put a foot in this unprofessional brasserie!!
"Our visit with quite an international company of friends ended hardly having started. Imagine a waiter saying 'If you don't like it here, go to some other place' after being asked to take away the empty bottles from the previous visitors and their garbage (he came to take our order with an empty tray). Disrespectful, shocking. I was like 'Is it really happening?' Especially shocking it was for the people for whom it was the first experience in Flanders which in its turn was advertised as the place where everybody is so extremely polite and the level of service is incomparable. One thing for sure - incomparable. Incomparably boorish and swinish. Shame. Way down u go people."
"This place is a disgrace to call it a noodle bar..Fist of all: no tap water..which we think is essential for good service..this allready shows they just want to rip of clients.We have travelled a LOT in Asia and visited many noodle bars, next to that we lived in Paris where any random noodle bar serves the same dishes for 4-5 times as cheap..so its really expensive and the quality is really bad. The duck tasted like roadkill.Then 'no card payment'...which is very unusual..the women started to be very unfriendly and rude. We went to get money from ATM, when we returned she waited to let us pay by just cleaning some dishes. Can u imagine this?When we made a remarc she started shouting to us..we have never been treated like this in a restaurant. A disgrace for a beautiful city like Ghent.Never go there: its a complete trap.Now you will see that they can't handle critics very well (just like during our visit) and they respond to all negative reviews on tripadvisor in the same fashion they would do at their bad restaurant: unrespectfull, rude and utterly unpolite."
I had the vol au vent and my partner had the fish and chips. Quality of food was very poor and I couldn't finish mine as a result. Very disappointed.
I am never coming back here! Overhyped. The steak was so undercooked it started eating the salad. The whole place was just dirty. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'DON'T EAT HERE!'
"Came pretty highly rated, but did not live up to expectations. We were seated and served drinks quickly, but for a restaurant that SPECIALIZES IN RIBS they had our modestly-sized group waiting for OVER AN HOUR for our ribs.

Not very impressive."
"We could not order anything here. The owner told us that we do not understand the beer, and then he's kick us out, saying that they are closing. (by the time they are only half an hour open). Several of our friends were looking for us in this pub, but he didn’t let them come in, saying, ""Get out of here, I already kicked out your friends!"" We are shocked by such rudeness. We had to look for another pub, but after finding it, it turned out that it also belongs to that person. And we were driven out again."
"The environment looks brilliant but you need more to be customer friendly. Went there with my wife and elderly mother (83) for dinner. Mother was going to limit her menu to a starter (Schrimp croquette with fries) and wine , water & coffee. Approximate value of € 30. We were told only a starter was not possible (even for elder people !) Our (my wife and me) plan was a starter and a main dish and coffee. Total min € 150. It was a no go so we decided to move on..."
"We tool the daily menu, which from the black board outside seemed tasty. Unfortunately, we asked for an explanation of the daily menu and it was literally: ""meat or pasta"". So we both went for meat... bad choice. A huge basquet of frites, and a pice of frozen breaded piece of ""meat"" came over... We were very hungry, and it also took quite a lot of time for not such a busy time. Disappointed, but yeah, I have to be honest, it was in front of the river, very well situated and the price was only 12€, so I don't know what I was expecting. May be the regular menu is good, though."
"Whenever I travel, I usually plan ahead and do some research to avoid places such as this one. This time around, I decided not to bother and let myself be surprised. Unfortunately, the surprise was not a pleasant one. The terrace right next to the canal is fairly pleasant though the tables were so closely packed that I could have a proper conversation with the person sitting three tables away. I ordered a salmon fillet with duchess potatoes, both of which were extremely dry and tasteless. The serving was extremely small, barely fit for a starter, let alone a main course! Additionally, the small, sorry salad which accompanied my lunch was wilted and stale. Even the water tasted funny, probably because the glass was not properly clean. Avoid! "
"this is very very expensive, it is done by the weight and you have no way of knowing how much you’re spending until you pay - somehow ended up paying 13 euros?! the quality of the yogurt is also poor, and the selection of flavours was awful. would not go again, and regretted my visit immediately"
"Well, it's called ""Beer Central,"" so expectations were high, with all these great bars in Ghent. Not as high as the prices, it turns out. The place was practically deserted, and with ridiculous prices like these, it's not hard to see why. I can have cheaper beers in central London! Our pregnant friend had a still water for € 3, for crying out loud!The beers are nothing special, you can find each of these easily, but there's 300 of them so there's at least that.The food was horrible and smelled funky, definitely not fresh, and the waiter didn't speak a word of English, nor did he know anything about beer. I mean what? In such a tourist-y place? And no knowledge of beer, at all, in a place called Beer Central??And lastly, the atmosphere wasn't fun either. Really bad music, way too bright, and not a single local customer to be spotted, always a bad sign. But the three of us coming in doubled the amount of customers anyways.It's not all bad, as we took a nice picture of the kegs in the cellar that smelled like the toilets nearby. But none of us would ever recommend this place. Really pricey for what it is, and what it is, is bad."
"This restaurant is located nicely off the canal, but don’t let it fool you. The servers know nothing about the food/wine they serve. I order a lasagna that came out with slices of ham inside. The cheese was also terrible, not a good Italian restaurant if that is what you are looking for. To make things worse, when we didn’t eat the food and sent it back but they still charged us for the full bill. After we sent it back it back the server never came , I had to go inside and find them to get the bill. Very bad food, bad service, don’t go here. There are so many other better places in Ghent."
"Terrible food and hygiene, the waiter did not know what is the Plate we asked for and the napkins were dirty.."
"The meat in the lomo saltado was hard as rubber. The other dishes of my friends were simply something else but not Peruvian. If you look for real Peruvian food DONT GO THERE! The owner was also not friendly, she didn’t accept any critic of the food. It’s also too much money for that they serve. Simply bad."
"Expect to spend all your day or evening the get served. We ordered 1 main course before continuing our visit of Ghent. Well,... our visit was over after all the waiting. 
Terrible experience.
Really.
Never again."
"Me and partner love Indian food. This was the worst Indian we have eaten. We were starving so ate it, but defo didn’t enjoy it. Paid the bill in full reluctantly. When we told the owner it was not great he began to raise his voice and said we had eaten it. The restaurant was full so embarrassed us. (We were very quiet and discreet when telling him). We paid quickly and left. Defo would never go back and as Ghent does not have great reviews on Indian food, choose another cuisine. But please do not eat here. The owner got very angry when we told him we didn’t enjoy it."
Absolutely terrible. The food lacked any kind of imagination or flavour. The staff were very rude and lacked any kind of training or professionalism. Service was terrible and we waited 45 minutes to get the dessert menu at which point we went and grabbed our own menus. It then took another 30 minutes to get an ice cream. The food was plain and boring and really disappointing. Avoid this place. Really not worth going to. Not one positive thing to say. 
"Bad-mannered staff, he served the menu right over my head ...with intention!  Let the client wait for too long before he catwalked to our table to get our order. That's him! on the right side of this photo."
"Won't be ordering from them again.Our order missed thé tartaar sauce, and also our joppie sauce. We called and they told us they would return with the missing sauces. So we waited while our fries were getting cold but none came. We called again and they plainly accused us of lying. The fries were okay but certainly not worth the trouble."
I am never coming back here! Overhyped. The steak was so undercooked it started eating the salad. The whole place was just dirty. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'DON'T EAT HERE!'
"I was waiting for about 20 min to order and for ask for drink was same waiting time, had to ask to the waiter 3 times and dessert eas the best part i got a banana split with a harder banana that the plastic one that my mom have decorating our table"
"I booked here 2 weeks earlier to have dinner with ex colleagues who came from fairly far away. I received a confirmation of the reservation for Tuesday the 21th of September and I received another reminder the day before. When we arrived, the restaurant was under a type of construction and we were quite rudely sent away without any kind of explanation or apology which left me crossing the town with my invitees searching for a restaurant that had place for us."
"when walking past this place, it really grabbed out attention. When walking in and ordering, we can say that disspointing is a grand under statement. The wine was cold, the food was bland, and the service was horrible. We do not reccomend this place at all."
"Cheese croquettes are passable but only because they are clearly bought in and deep fried. Vol au vent is terrible because it is basically a gunky sauce with no taste and barely reheated served over cold chicken, tinned tasteless mushrooms and rancid pastry. 

Never again!"
"We wait 2 hours for 3 hamburger. We miss a part of the movie. The Organization is so poor that they should open only for 10 people, they cannot manage more. The ginger ale was just water with ice. 
Never anymore"
I am never coming back here! Overhyped. The steak was so undercooked it started eating the salad. The whole place was just dirty. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'DON'T EAT HERE!'
Ordered my meal at 18.45 on 9th of May paid and I was given No27 45mins later when my break was over I still had not been served and I got no apology no refund nothing most ignorant staff I have ever come across in all my 20 Years truck driving just writing this review so others won’t have to deal with these people who work a job they clearly hate well I hope they all get fired.
"Avoid! Beat point is the Service is fine. Food is basically microwave or frozen pizza served up with a massive mark up. 
Avoid at all costs!"
"It seemed a great idea to do the laundry and eat after work. So, I did a reservation online with a message that I wanted to do laundry, finding a spot at 7:30 PM . They close on 9:00 and I hoped I could get the indications to finish in time because of course I wouldn't want to go back to the hotel with wet laundry! I tried to obtain this indications with little luck. The machines were not respected the time. I picked the shortest time for washing- 20 minutes and the shortest for drying- 40 minutes but at 9 o'clock I was just sitting in front of the machine waiting for the program to finish and they asked to ""wait outside"". I asked what about the laundry and they said they do not care, stop the machine if we want them. They were irritated (understandably) but I really tried to communicate what I need and expected the answer about what is possible. I think instead (or better alongside) of funny instructions (they are) it would be better to indicate how much time everything takes and to be aware that if it's to late- to not use it. In reality what I think is that it is only a bar, the washing machines were a great idea but now are only just design. Because, to be fair, the food was good."
"I paid through Google Pay but the restaurant's computer system didn't register it, even though I showed several members of staff that the money had come out of my account. We were kept waiting for 10 minutes whilst our waiter asked us to stay put even though we had to leave to catch our train to the Eurostar. When a more senior member of staff came over to show us a spreadsheet of payments, she insisted forcefully that we come inside to see the spreadsheet better out of the sunlight. Having navigated the odd layout and tightly packed furnishings of the terrace whilst worrying about the timeframe, several members of staff crowded around us to insist on a second payment. When I refused saying the money had already left my account, they said they were 'honest people' who would refund me the second payment within 24 hours if the first one wasn't refunded. I've now asked them three times to refund payment and waited over 4 days and still have received nothing back; they now appear to be ignoring my request. Such a shame that our last day in Ghent was ruined by two overpriced salads, slow service and a rude farewell. Would not recommend!"
"The restaurant is located just across the Ghent Castle and close to the city centre where we were staying.We wanted to dine in the restaurant next to it but since it was full had to go to this one.we sat outside.Our's is a young family with two 22 months old twin daughters.We requested for two high chairs.One arrived, for the other one we had to remind the staff several times before they brought one.We ordered for drinks which were promptly served.Both my daughters started playing with the plastic tissue stand to which the waiter objected and took away which was fine.My daughter dropped the menu card.The waiter got furious and said we should have some respect for the menu card.We ignored it and were ordering, my husband took a few minutes to understand the dishes to whixh the waiter sad to call him when we are ready to order.My husband then requested him to bring us the bill wihch he brought and said that we should teach some manners to our children and that we were disrespectful and ungrateful.The least you can expect from people in the hospitality industry is courtesy and politness.The food comes later.We live in London,UK and have been to several restaurants with our kids but nowhere have been we treated so badly and rudely.If you have children don't go anywhere near this restaurant."
"The attitude of the waiters is horrible. My friends and I have such a bad time. We ordered five main courses for five people, including lamb, ribs, shrimp, steak and a vegetarian burger. The ribs is all you can eat. We wait for almost an hour for the food. When my friend wanted to refill the ribs, they had such a bad attitude. They refilled other people's plates but purposely ignored our table. We asked them politely to refill the rib, and he just rudely threw it to our plate. One time, a waiter received our order and asked another waiter to refill the ribs. The second waiter who came, teased us and asked if we ""want all?"" even though we only asked for one refill. It's so obvious that they are being sarcastic. We guess the waiters hadsuch bad attitude because we shared the ribs, and that we were taking advantage of the restaurant. However, the truth is that we had ordered a main course for each person. We shared some food but we don't deserve this attitude. We didn't have mood to order any drinks afterwards. To be fair, the food was fine but their attitude ruined everything. If the waiters had any issue, they could just tell us instead of being rude and teasing. Fyi, the waiter doesn't speak good English and we need help to translate from other customer. "
"We sat down at 8:10 for dinner and an our in we had only had our starter. At around 9:00 we asked for more prawn crackers as we were very hungry. The waitress said she didn’t work in the kitchen and it was only one bowl of prawn crackers per table. She finally brought some more out but wasn’t very happy about it and slammed the bowl down without saying anything.At half 9 they said they are making the food right now and it will be 5 minutes.When they did bring the dishes out they were the wrong ones and we stood up to leave, as so many other tablets had done since we had been there. They finally brought out the right plates after we had put money on the table and picked up our bags to leave. We explained to the staff we were not happy with the service and would only like to pay for one main.Waitress argued that they couldn’t lower the price and instead of being apologetic they were very argumentative. Waitress said we should have said earlier if we weren’t happy and we weren’t going to pay and they just wouldn’t have made our food.We said we stood up with our bags and was about to leave at half 9 so not sure what more we could have said to show we weren’t happy. 10% off our bill finally after a student waitress spoke to the manager. The manager did not come over to our table to speak to us but instead argued with the student waitress across the restaurant. I would like to add that the food was absolutely amazing and we could not fault that, but the experience we had would make us not come back and advise other people to avoid.You can find good Thai food elsewhere in Ghent."
We visited here on our current trip to Brussels as we wanted a quick lunch. I went to use the toilet here and was greeted by an incredibly rude Belgian woman who was charging for the toilets - I paid reluctantly as I was needing the toilet and went to use the cubicle. As I went the woman grabbed me by the wrist and shouted at me in French and her and another man started laughing. I explained that paying to use a toilet in a restaurant where I had already paid for a meal was disgusting?!! Let alone not being allowed to use the cubicle! I spoke to a staff member on the counter who clearly was not bothered about this at all ** Quick take note please as this is disgusting service!! ** I will not be visiting a quick ever again.
"Never experienced such terrible staff attitude. Service was rubbish also. Had to wait almost an hour for a table and during that time the staff were very rude, in particular the female staff. When we did get a table the attitude continued. A shame really because the food was good. Will not return or would recommend. "
"I went here with my friends to drink a good beer and enjoy our night, but the rude young waiter destroied the atmosphere! We asked an easy and gentile request and he answered in a bad way with insults and arrogance. After a request of explanation, he answered to go out from the local and said ""you italians are stupid guys"", so also became racist, Compliments!If you want to enjoy your beer and your night, don't go in this place!"
"What a horrible experience we had last night. It was chaos. Some people had to pay to get in, others could go in for free. The bouncer was very unfriendly. First we could go in for free then suddenly I had to pay but my boyfriend didn't. My other friend then payed for me but he also didn't have to pay. Two female staff members litterally dragged me out of the bar upstairs when I was asking the people behind the bar if they could call a taxi for my friend who wasn't feeling well. My boyfriend had to stop them from attacking me. I'm 42 years old and I have two children. I have never been treated so disrespectfully as in that bar last night. I'm going to file a complaint with the police. I also believe that some of the staff was not sober which makes it a dangerous and unpredictable situation when there is a disagreement of some sort."
"Lunch on Easter Sunday. Arrive towards 13:00 Starters came over after an hour. 1 starter forgotten, even drinks came late. Served main course around 15:30. By the time we were so frustrated that it was hard to enjoy the good food provided. The place is clearly under-staffed also leading the staff to look over worked and arrogant."
"Very uninspiring Cafe, maybe we had picked the 'wrong items' on the menu but they were very overpriced. We had a croque monsieur, which was 2 slices of toasted white bread with a small salad, and we had a quiche. The quiche was ok-ish, everything else wasnt tasty and very un-special but quite pricy."
I think supermarkets serve better waffles than here. Thankfully the banana and chocolate sauce was fresh enough to salvage the dish. Terrible waffle for a place in such a prime location
"Seeing some of the great reviews here we went here thinking we will have a nice decent pizza. Unfortunately it was not the case, I ordered a vegetariana and it was just drowned in tasteless, cheap cheese. The quality of the ingredients is really bad and my glass of wine came with a fly in it. Better to avoid "
The only pro of this place is the location. Staff was very unfriendly serving us drinks and I had to go inside to pay at the bar being attended to by another unfriendly and uninterested person. Avoid!
Big portions but pastas which are microwaved? Too bad unfortunately....We had higher expectations! The prices are quite high for past but you are in Gent so you expected to pay no less than 15€/person. I would not give it a 2nd try!
"De Superette is golden boy Kobe Desramaults' newest invention, after De Vitrine and Michelin starred In De Wulf. It is meant to be a backery first and foremost: you can buy (pricey) loafs of bread, have breakfast and order freshly baked pizza.I went there for dinner on my own one evening and had to sit through a whole lecture on the philosophy of sharing plates, which in my case was kind of irrelevant, me being, as could be easily ascertained, on my own. And left all alone after that, since they flatly forgot about my order! I waited an hour for my food to arrive and then had to leave starving. Normally I'm apprehensive of one star reviews based on a single bad experience, but from what I saw happening around me, mine was not an isolated case. Plenty going wrong at The Superette in the kitchen and in the front of the house (""White wine, sir?"" - ""Nope"" - Waiter staring in the distance, ""So here's that lamb you were still waiting for weren't you?"" - ""Yes. Thank you. Finally"").I'm sure the food is great once you get to that stage. Oh well, never did the kebab from a nearby diner taste as good as it did that night."
"They rushed us out of there, weren't friendly at ALL. Our waiter didn't seem to care about severe allergies, they weren't giving us a proper explanation about the ingredients. 
Would never go there again !!"
"If you like dog food and on top being treated like a dog this is the right place for you : never seen waiters like this, very rude and pretending this is funny, I had to calm them down actually, throwing the food on the table, putting a glass of wine in front of a 12 year old, basically endless mistakes and consistent misbehavior.Had a Belgian stew with fries that were so poor you really wonder where to got this from. I'm sure the worst frietkot beats this place quality wise. This is a total disgrace for the city of Ghent."
"My friend and I went here for lunch one day of our vacation and enjoyed the food so we decided to go back the last day of our trip. The manager was the only reason we walked out and didn't eat there again. He was very blatantly rude. He had a very loud angry phone conversation while we looked at the menu. He told us that he could not split the bill or let us pay with card less than 50 euro but not in the kind, I'm sorry way. We also couldn't order tap water (they let us the day the manager wasn't there). He said it must have been the ""little girl"" that served us wrong. He was a real jerk to say the least. He acted like he didn't care for our business, like he was better than us, and had better places to be. I would not give my money to this place so we left. No wonder we were the only people in the restaurant."
"It was a nice location, right in front of Gravensteen castle. But we later on regretted to have chosen this restaurant. The food was acceptable, but service very slow and rude. When we made some remarks about this we were treated like undesired guests."
We walked in near 8pm and were directed to an empty upstairs. Attempted to order drinks and desserts and were told it was an eating establishment and she needed to ask her manager if we could stay. She came back and offered to move us to a couch and deliver the desserts and drinks there. We were so confused. The place was empty. We are a family of six and would have spent 40 euro on drinks and desserts in 30 mins and planned to quickly leave. Lost our business....forever. Warning future travelers to avoid this place. 
"It's not often I come across a restaurant that displays incompetence right across the board, but this one fits the bill perfectly. If the large numbers of flies in the place as we sat down should have warned us what was coming, the manager's cheerful explanation that they were 'just beer-flies, like fruit-flies only bigger' should have made us walk out immediately. Sadly, we did not.A couple of drowned Pork Cheeks, a tough Flemish Stew and a sadly-deconstructed Vol-au-Vent later, along with fries that were about as Belgian as a Glasgow chippie, we left feeling completely scammed by the experience. Drinks were fine, though it's tough for even awful management to screw up what comes out of a bottle. Service was slow and clumsy....no attention to water requirements, drink refills, plate removal.Throughout our 90-minute visit on a Thursday night in July, we were four of a total of eight customers in the joint. Not surprising really given the standard of operation and management, not to mention the ridiculous prices being charged. We spent a week in Ghent and this experience was far below the generally excellent standard we received in all our other restaurant visits.The response to other critical reviews from their management is to write long rebuttals rather than accept they need to improve or go bust. I have no doubt they will respond to this review in the same way.The restaurant business is really not suited for some people."
"After covid lockdown we wanted to go and eat mussels. The Nenuphar is apparently known for them. We called ahead; however, we were told there were not going to be any. We still made reservations.Yes, mussels were mentioned on the menu, but since our phone call only 2 days prior to the reservation, we did not give any attention to them.The order was made. Not even 3 minutes (!) we saw mussels being served. I got up and asked our waitress to change the order. The answer : NOT POSSIBLE. Seriously, we were changing a Vol au Vent for mussels. Vol au vent is a ready made dish that just needs a biscuit in the oven !The waitress came back stating she asked the Maitre D’ and the answer was NO CHANGE POSSIBLE.At that point I was really disappointed. I went to see the Maitre D’. I explained that it is not difficult to change the order since Vol au Vent is ready made AND it takes all in all 5 minutes to prepare mussels. Moreover, we took a starter !I was told that order would possibly take longer. I accepted. HOWEVER, 90 minutes in we only received our starter. Are you serious?Not even an apology, a free coffee to sweeten the wate?NEVER, EVER again. There are too many choices for good restaurants where customer service is actually applied."
"We went here to enjoy some meat and a beer, although there wasn't much to enjoy. Staff wasn't as friendly as in other places and the food tasted horrible, I ate it all because I was terribly hungry, but honestly my stomach didn't deserve to go through this. Will never go here again! "
The standard of food was very poor and meal was overpriced for what it was. Definitely would not recommend. When we told the staff the meal was not good at the end they were rude.
"Really very bad experience, there were three of us sitting at the table, after ordering we waited more than an hour after our solicitous invite us to go communicating that we have problems in the stove ... absurd, so they also charge us for the drinks we had brought before for € 6.00 bad not recommended obviously we were fasting"
"Visited 1745 on a Saturday evening - we were quickly informed on arrival by the waitress before we could sit down that as we were not staying to eat they couldn't serve us as it was food customers only after 6pm. It was 1745, the bar was 25% full and there were young couples sitting enjoying a drink. Blatantly turned us away because we have small children. Unacceptable behaviour and needs to be called out"
"We were four, including two elderly ladies. One of them and her daughter were told by this extremely rude waitress (probably the owner) that they were not allowed to share one of the menu’s options that included two toasties, because “there would be only one set of cutlery and she was not there for charity”. After uttering this in a scornful way, she took the bags of the mother and daughter that were on a chair of the table close to us (the restaurant was empty, we were the only ones in there!) and sort of threw them on the floor. We decided not to stay, and while leaving there was still this man behind the counter (the husband maybe?) shouting that he was still the boss there. Unbelievable."
"If you have a whole evening to spare and you don't mind the management not caring about the service then eat here. The food is good and reasonably priced however there are not enough staff to cope or they have a go slow policy. The hotel had booked for us and we were a party of 10 people. After arrival and being sent to the table we had 20 minutes wait before we were acknowledged, 20 minutes further before we were given menus, further 20 minutes before drink orders were taken, 10 minutes after food orders taken, 10 more minutes drinks arrived. Over an hour later the food was served. One order was incorrect. Throughout the whole meal we kept trying to get noticed to see what was causing the delay. End of the evening, we put our comments to the manager whose response was ""this is belgium, its different to the UK and I really don't care that your service was slow......"". We added up the bill to the correct amount and left cash however the manager decided we were 1euro short and sent his waiter running down the road to collect it......perhaps he should think about having a better employer."
"My husband had been a few times and wanted to return to celebrate his birthday, I 've been twice and have always been disappointed.So we went with our children on a friday night anyway, the food took ages to come, so long that we didn't have to pay for the wine or water and once we had paid the very embarrassed maitre d said :"" now you are finally free to go""I would have been gone after the first drink without paying, nearly two hours to get any food. Come on"
"Terrible service! Waited 15 min before they came to take the order and had to wait 45 min to an hour before they came with the food. Ordered extra fries, did not get them. Rude and arrogant waiters. When asked to pay they don't give you a bill but just tell you how much.. You cannot check if everything is correct. Extra fries were still on the bill after we asked to see the bill. Food wasn't great. Waist of time and money."
We didn't actually eat here because it took 15 minutes just to get someone to give us a menu. After a further 15 minutes of looking at the menu we still didn't have a drink so we gave up and went to de Graslei. Another couple at the table next to us left at the same time. They hadn't even managed to get a menu! 
"Sorry but the food wasn't great quality though the price was :-(.
Friendly personnel but i had the impression it was a bit ""made"".
Interior and food are not up with the high prices asked. The worst in this price-category."
"We were recommended to come here and unfortunately we did not check trip advisor prior to going which we normally do.We arrived to a rather sour front manager.No smiles or welcome, basically he pointed to coat racks and had someone show us to the table. Menu looked nice but unfortunately the entrees were average and out of 4 main meals 3 were hardly touched, we were not asked if we enjoyed the food however we told the waitress the meals were too salty. There was little care factor.The bill came extreme quickly as did the card machine, shame the table was not cleared as quickly after starters and mains. As we left no farewell or assistance was given as the manager was busy looking at shirts from top shop website at the desk.We decided that after experiencing our most expensive meal in Ghent and sadly the worst we would get desert elsewhere rather than be disappointed again.The restaurant is a lovely building with nice decor and it looked like the adjacent bar could be nice.Hopefully someone in management who cares will look at all the reviews and make some changes here."
"Last week we were lucky to get hold of the last table outside. After a few minutes, the waiter came out to get the order. Then, we waited, and waited, and waited. Never saw anyone come back. The other tables eventually got their drinks en napkins, but I think that we must have become invisible by then. So we left. The only thing I can do is giving a low score. Sorry, but that's the way it works."
"We had made a reservation to Pakhuis using their website to do that. We got a confirmation email. So, they had our email address and phone number. And what happened when we got there? It was closed!!!!!! No information was given about that. Just a confirmed reservation. Most annoying."
"The service isn't great. We ordered our food and then were forgotten about. 45 minutes later we asked about our food and then it was hastily thrown together and wasn't very hot. We mentioned how lukewarm the food was to the staff and they couldn't have been less concerned. No apologies, nothing. The food wasn't even that good. There are other Turkish places down this road so maybe they're a bit better?"
Portions of order were missed. Hostess was careless. Expected better service. Menu has many options but service wasn't satisfactory.
After eating in few restaurant in the dark street in gent and we went to kin khan after recommended from one of the neighbouring restaurant where we had eaten few days before. Nice modern restaurant but the seating is very uncomfortable and it seems like that this is done on purpose so people don’t sit very long and make way for others after getting tired of seating. This is not a restaurant but a factory who is busy taking guest in and out . Food is not Thai and it’s more adjusted to European style and spicy ness couldn’t be adjusted makes me think if things are really fresh ? ... take this as a positive comment and improve guys . Good luck
"Like two previous reviewers we were badly treated in this restaurant by the same waiter in the phoney naval jacket. We were ignored while we waited an hour for our food to arrive during which at least three sets of diners who arrived after us were served. The irony was we were not encouraged to read the menu but rushed into ordering our food. I complained to the manager. The most upsetting rudeness was NOT one member of staff, including the manager apologised or offered any recompense. Do not visit this restaurant if you want good service. Arrogance is the name of their game, not customer satisfaction. We left without eating."
"On arrival, the waiter first didn't want to assign me a seat, because I came alone and would be occupying a table for 2. The staff only speaks elementary Dutch and their English is not much better. Furthermore, they were more busy with entertaining each other than their guests. I ordered lamb terriyaki and some inside-out sushi. The inside-out sushi was kind of okay, but certainly not top quality. They had forgotten my terriyaki and after some 30 minutes the waitress informed if I had finished dining. I told her I was still waiting for the terriyaki. The lamb was as tough as an old shoe and when I told the waitress that it was way overcooked. Her response was that next time I should mention during ordering that I don't want it overcooked. Also the dishes were extremely small, considering their prices.It took them ages to get me the bill and my change. This was one of the very rare occassions that I didn't tip, so poor was the food and service. I went to a soup lounge around the corner where I got an excellent supplementary meal for 1/8th of what I had paid in this ""restaurant""."
"Too late for us to read also other bad reviews from other customers, which were so true in our experience. If you don’t know Dutch/French, the restaurant is way far too “busy” for you. We made reservations in English but was shocked that they didn’t offer English menu. The staff didn’t give a second to explain what options they have, but said “you know it is a rib restaurant?!” They didn’t have the drink I want but insist “you must order drink” without even pointing me to the right page of their menu.Sadly, the food was equally disappointing. You wouldn’t need to refill because the ribs are so dry and tasteless itself without the source.Not to mention how inconvenient and ridiculous about the seating arrangement if you have a child. We were asked to bring our buggy upstairs and left it between someone else tables away from us, while there were plenty of space in the reception area upstairs. Before we left, we reflected our disappointment about their service. The very rude staff said, “We offer you spare ribs. We help you with food, with drink, what you want?!” Honestly, it does not worth a go for the spareribs in exchange for such a horrible experience.Luckily, in the end we finally spoke to the manager, who got a more sensible attitude and apologised for the staff rudeness."
"This place is nicely situated in the antique city center. The food was quite basic in relation to the high price tag. I assume that you pay for the view and I guess that's okay.However, the service was insulting and our overall experience was very bad. We ordered the salad with raw salmon and goat cheese and were served the cooked salmon with nuts. Which can happen, right? But when we told the waiter that we ordered something else, he asked us to keep it nontheless, because else he would have a problem.We explained that we did not want to eat the dish, to which he requested, again, that we should just eat it. This repeated two more times and only after the fourth time, he accepted No for an answer. He cursed, when he took the plate. He asked us where we were from, supposedly questioning our manners.We felt so uncomfortable that when the chef brought us yet another wrong dish (the panini with salmon), we would just take it. It tasted good, anyway.In total, although this is situated in a nice location, I cannot recommend the restaurant until they fix their service."
"I went there for lunch with some friends. First of all, if you go there in a group you can't order more than 4 different dishes (no sense). Second, we waited too long for the food (at least 40 minutes). Third, my chicken filet was dry and the sauce wasn't enough. Forth, OVERPRICED. It was really a bad experience, not recommended at all."
We arrived at 19:30 and we only were served at 21:40! They forgot about us and we had to re-ask for the food! The food was good but the service is terrible! The waiters are not even nice and they instead of excuse they imply that it's actually our fault!
You could go here if you fee like receiving bad service and paying 16 euros for a frozen pizza. Not coming back.
"Just Flemish (really difficult language to understand!) menu. We wanted to order just 3 starters, and we could not, because they could cook for us just ordering also the courses. So they showed us the exit! Really really bad!I am working in Belgium - I find belgium people, very nice people - I was in Gent on holiday with my parents and such a ugly situation!"
"We drove from Bruges to eat balls and glory at gent with my pregnant wife , When arriving at the place the guy was friendly to explain us how the concept works but he got interrupted by another man(owner?) whom took our order , afterwards came so many people in and we sat down and saw just all their meal get served to their table more then 4 tables. We waited a bit but our meal didn’t came , so we went to the counter to ask about our food and our answer we’ve got was “ I know you people are used to get your food in 2 min” witch was for us really surprising to hear we didn’t know what that actually mean? So we asked and he tried to keep saying that orders can be before our order done to other people’s table . We just canceled our order because the man was very rude and not respectful at all , me as a Japanese I’m not used to treated with such an low education, I hope and I don’t think it was a racist act , it’s just some people don’t realise meaning of hospitality service , I hope this message arrive to this person so he can avoid im the future this kind of problems."
"Twice I came here, twice they forgot my order. The last time was the worst. I sat there clearly waiting, where the entire staff could see me. People came in, ordered, ate and left while I was sitting there. Eventually I went up to ask if they forgot my order. They said they didn't, and gave me a plate that was on the waiting stand. ""They just finished your meal, sir!"". When I ate it, it was completely COLD. Not a little bit, just crazy cold. Highly disappointed. No one from staff seemed to care that they gave me this."
"Waited 40mins for a our drinks to arrive, which turned out to be wrong. Food was cold, and was missing side orders, then waited 20mins for the bill! Not good."
"We had only just opened the door at prime lunch time, to be met by a miserable and very curt lady informing us that they were full and even though it was only 1pm and a table was finishing desert, she wasn't going to serve any more tables, having told her we were happy to wait. We would have considered going back in the evening as the place looked lovely, but her attitude really put us off - there are lots of lovely restaurants to choose from in this usually very friendly city!"
The salad is so fresh that we found worms in 3 salads on 6. We told the waiters about this and they replied they jumped in from the street.They don't care at all about the complains and don't really know how to deal with customers. Worst service ever had!!I don't recommend it to anyone.I hope this would help the other people to choose not to go anymore. Thanks!
"- there was a long line before we could enter due to several shifts in the restaurant, although we made a reservation- service was not personal, because they had so many things on their mind. This way, they seemed very unfriendly- having the feeling you were eating in a factory (we were out of the restaurant after less then an hour)-Ribs were qualitatively less good than other ribs i have tasted so far. Small, not enough sauce, a lot of tiny bones"
"We went for Brunch on Saturday at noon but we couldn't get a table since we didn't have a reservation. Food is ok but the service is not good, unless you speak good Flemish. Avoid weekends unless you made a reservation."
"They seated me for a late lunch. I ordered the soup of the day for €5 and the lobster bisque for €10, and after taking the order the lady who seated me came back and told me they would not serve me if I only ordered soup and that they would need the table for someone who wanted to order a main as well."
"We had reservation for 9, but still were pushed to choose the suggested menu because it was too busy according to the waiter. If we wanted to eat à la carte it would have taken 1 to 1,5 h between courses. Having worked in restaurants for 20 years myself, we decided to go along with the suggested menu...Appetizer OK, but nothing more than that. First course was (=should have been) a tartar of tuna... It was so small we thought it was second appetizer... Maybe 10 grams of tuna, the rest was (undefinable) dressing and guacomole(?). Second course choice: 5 small slices of lamb filet with 4 pieces of potatoe and undefinable dressing again. Everybody at our table was waiting for the waiter to come with a second round of food, unfortunately this didn't happen...Dessert was pineapple in 5 different ways, but only 4 showed up according to the waiter.The coffee was the best part of the whole meal. For giving us these snacks it took them 3,5 hours and it costed 67 € / person. Since we had time enough between courses I checked out the whole place: half of the outdoor seats where free, indoors still 4 tables not taken... While we were having dessert, the bos was chatting on the outdoor terrace with some friends/customers... Get int o your kitchen and make us some (real) food, you lazy b... The waiter said it was packed! One party of 8 people left because they were pushed to take the suggested menu: they made the right choice!Overpriced, overrated ( also on tripadvisor, which I tend to trust ), poor service, tourist trap: we all left the place hungry, and not one of us is an XL..."
"Can’t recommend this place. Super unfriendly staff, bad quality regarding food! Please save your money!"
The mainwaiter was very unpolite. There were a lot of people waiting for orders and he didn’t help to organice the kitchen nor serve the tables. He only said we must wait.
"We picked this restaurant because it was convenient. The waiter suggested the filet mignon and my husband told me to try it. He ordered the Quiche. We both ordered salads. The service was terrible! The steak was too tough to eat. I left it and tried to get the waiter to return. My husband tried to summon the waiter, but was unsuccessful. The salads were very mediocre. My husband’s Quiche was very bland. We never received water or bread that was promised. The waiter finally showed up 40 minutes later with a bill. When I complained he just smiled and was very rude. He then left. He made no effort to say he was sorry or make some allowance for a meal that was not eaten. The restaurant is expensive and terrible. The service is awful. We can’t figure out why it is busy. The only reason might be it is in a great location. Avoid this restaurant and find anywhere else to eat."
"The restaurant looked pretty nice so we decided to give it a shot. It was very busy in Gent and this was one of the last places to eat (later we understood why). We ordered for starters the fried shrimps and shrimp and cheese croquettes, as it looked very nice on the menu. We received a few shrimps with a plastic cup of mayonaise. For 14€ we received 1 cheesecroquette and 1 shrimpcroquette, it was pretty discusting. We wanted to leave and had to pay 34€ in total for a few bites. The staff was very rude to me when me and my boyfriend asked if we could pay. They ignored me, didn't ask why we didn't eat it and why we left. I would definitely not recommend eating here! Would rather go to the MacDonald next time :/"
"The worse sushi I ever ate, even because there was almost no fish (salmon or tuna), only crab with mayo! Wasting money..."
"The four of us went to this restaurant last week. It was lunchtime and there were still plenty of empty tables. As it was lunch and we would be having a meal out later that evening we ordered 2 pizza's and 1 salad to share between the four of us and 4 drinks. We were told by a very stroppy rude waiter that he was not very pleased with this and that we should be ordering a pizza each. We left the restaurant and would certainly not return, there are so many lovely restaurants in Gent that really would not mind people sharing lunch."
Just terrible. Can't understand the positive reviews. One of the worst Indian restaurant experiences ever. Tasteless and fat food. Avoid.
"The place is dirty and unhygienic. They don't show the prices of anything, but you think ""well, it's bad beer in an obviously illegal place, it can't be that much."" When the moment of paying arrives the owner wants to charge you 6 euro for the same beers that would cost 3 euro in any nice place in the city. It's just a terrible scam for tourists."
"If you order a crepe zuzette would you expect pan cakes? Sure! But at Domestica you get a vol au vent without pastry. Yes, I am right. And they don’t care."
"If I could give it a zero out of 5 stars I would. We arrived around lunch hour. There were already 6 other people inside waiting by the entrance. We could see two tables were available and asked the people who'd arrived before us why they weren't seated there. ""They told us we weren't allowed to sit there because the tables haven't been wiped down yet."" Strange but ok. Another 10 minutes went by. We saw a group of 4 people finish their meal and leave. A blonde young waitress cleared their vacated table and still didn't show the people in front of us to their table even though clearly no one was sitting there. She proceeded to let a bunch of people pay for their meals, ignoring all of us standing by the entrance, waiting to be seated. Mind you, we hadn't even been greeted and we'd been standing there for at least 15 minutes. A tip for the waitress: when you clear a table, wipe it down as well immediately. It takes maybe 10 seconds. That way you can show the guests to their table immediately instead of leaving them standing at the entrance for 15 minutes, while rudely ignoring their presence. We decided we would not be paying for this type of rude, unprofessional service and left. We dined at a lovely restaurant next door where we were given professional service. Never going back to Ellis Burger in Ghent."
As noted below servers are surely and you can not split a pizza with someone. Business must be so good they can afford the bad reviews. What makes things all the worse is the food is not bad and they do have a great central location. 
We entered to ask for a table (me my wife and little 2 year old ) the little boy who was taking order looked and me from head to toe when I asked a table for two and the little girl. (They had 3 available tables) he responded he was not sure I asked again implying there were 3 tables available. He replied I am not sure look people are coming in and we were the only people coming in. I got very upset and told him it was easier if he would have told nether did not accept people with children. Very rude.
"Are you familiar with a rude character that acts as a prison guard in some WWII movie?The main waitress in this place might remind you just of that. I've been going to this place very often since 2011 when I moved to Gent. And while the service was always quite bad, we always thought: let's give it another try! Italian places in Gent are not to die for, and Il Cortile offered some decent food. The last two times have been particularly awful in terms of service that we swore we are never stepping foot in this place again. After making a reservation we went to have lunch (3 ppl and a baby). They had set a table near the window. Because the sun was unbearable to the little one and to us adults, we kindly asked if we could move to a different table at the back of the restaurant. Never in my life have I seen such a rude and inconsiderate reaction from the waitress (who I think is the co-owner of the place) who said that it is not possible to change the table. It really seemed irrational to witness such a reaction from her part. I She then threw the plates on our table to show how pissed she was that we asked to be removed."
"Found this place using TA, looked really good. We arrived and they were full (always a good sign) so were told to come back in 15 mins.We were shown to our table and that's where we sat for 30 mins, no menu, no water, no drinks. Our order was eventually taken and we had to wait another 20 mins for just the drinks and bread to turn up. We then waited another 30 mins for food to come out (only arrived after I asked where it was) At no point were we checked on, asked for more drinks ect. We finished our.... food, It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. For the price I expected better in truth. The service really showed its colors when we were asked why we did not finish the wine (there was ligitamiltly a fly in it) she shruged her shoulders and just took it away! no replacement. The service here was terrible, I was made to feel like we had inconvenienced her simply by being there. In short, Id recommend against this place, perhaps we got it on a bad day but as it was to celebrate an anniversary it put a cloud over the evening. If I had the service here I would have just walked out."
"This place should carry the passion and kindness that the majority of Belgians do... HOWEVER, the waitresses were very unpleasant. They put the bill down on the table and picked up the money without even giving us eye contact. We waited 15 minutes before the staff even gave us a drinks menu despite them asking if we were drinking or eating on arrival. This is not the type of service you expect when paying the price you do for their beer menu. Its a shame i cant give it a 0. NOT WORTH IT. GO TO ANOTHER BAR. "
"Worst service ever! We waited for over 30minutes, but for some readon, the waiter did not want to serve us. Better spend your money some place else!"
"Everything is in the lavish decor. Food is not tasty at all. We got tap water and got charged about 15€ for 5 small glasses of water. The waiter told us that we had spring water by error. When I asked to see the bottle, he got confused and said that it was from a big bottle that is not in the menu. In other words, water is served from the kitchen at the glass.Once I asked a gesture, the owner got very angry and absolutely not customer friendly (with menacing behavior).I’m not even talking about the dry chicken sate without sauce. TO AVOID"
"I've visited this place for lunch a while back, intrigued by the menu and offerings I decided to go with a chicken burger with chutney on it. The waiter asked me if I wanted a small starter, chicken with some lettuce and chutney in a small cup. It all sounded amazing so I said yes, sure.The starter was just plain bad. Tasteless tiny pieces of chicken and the bottom 30% of the tiny cup was the chutney that made my eyes tear up just by being in the proximity of it. Like peeling and chopping onions. Thousands of onions...Boy did I regret that, I regularly eat Thai chillies and South American peppers that would be considered inedible in Europe. But this was on another level, I thought I was going die. Literally die.Then I thought you know what? Let's skip the starter and go for the burger and the fries. This can't get any worse, right?*Spoiler alert; it was even worse!*The bread was sort of old but not yuck? Can't really describe it. The slab of chicken was err... Chewy. Dry and chewy. Oh and tasteless. And to top it all off, they smeared the whole bun with that same extreme chutney. I mean, really?!Let's head to the fries then! Well, they were edible. Too bad they were dark brown in color because of the old grease that's apparently being used. Luckily for me, I could enjoy the grease with my fries, they were dripping with it.So just to recap.Pro:+ Friendly staff I suppose.Con:-- Bad Food.-- Steep Prices.-- Inedible Food.-- Oh and did I mention the Bad Food?"
"I wanted to love this place. Our last meal in Belgium. Cute place. That's it!  Tasteless soup, overcooked vegetables, tiny portions,overpriced including $3 for two small glasses of what was probably tap water; slow service. No frills lunch for two - $50."
"If you ever feel like travelling back into time Stapsteen is a great way to start. I do not know many early nineties enthusiasts; however that is where Stapsteen is taking you. The interior is one thing, and no: we will not call it vintage. The food is a reminder of better days as well: when people actually liked heavy, greasy dishes. Noteworthy: the average age of the guests is well over 60. Service was a total disaster: the lack of organisation was almost comical. Bad experience, never again."
"I had ordered serveal times from Panda- I always liked the food. However, yesterday I ordered 2 dishes plus rice plus Mi-hun. It had clearly come from a fridge and the microwave, because some pieces of meat were nice and hot, and some were ice cold, in the same dish and the same box! The same was true for the rice and chicken! when I called to complain however- again, I am a regular customer- the woman on the phone first said: ""I think you are exaggerating"", followed by: it is impossible becuz the food is being cooked here in an open kitchen"". This of course, does not exclude the possibility of storing leftovers in the fridge, especially since the people at home don't see it anyway.I then asked her why I would call if it weren't true; she didn't have an answer but repeated that I was not telling the truth (literally! This is a quote).I could only think one thing: never again."
"Service is awful, as always owner is as arrogant as possible, thinking he has a Michelin star. All the bad reviews complain as always about the service and owner. Overpriced, and cherry on top when I entered people were leaving as they were tired of waiting.This place just needs to shut down."
"It was raining cats and dogs so the hot chocolate with marshmallows and chantilly seemed to me very tasty. Unfortunately even after 40 minutes I had not been served. The first one was given to somebody else who arrived later, then the waitress said there was another one ready to be served - for me. But I never got it. So I left without. Not a good experience. Bye, bye Afsnis."
Took 40 minutes to serve the starters and once asked the status with the only reply that they would be coming. My partner had a choice to be made for a dessert and gave a sign a couple of times to the staff without any action. Our complaint about this lack of service was waived away as not being relevant. Food was fine.
"The place is nice in itself, and the waiter tries to be friendly and helpful. No complaint about the service.However the food was terrible (macaroni with cheese). I could not eat it: too salty, way too much cheese.Just come here for a drink is OK. Wi-Fi is good too."
I just hated everything about this restaurant! I came 2 times the first time me and my husband eat then we pay the money ! The next day we were leaving ghent my husband wanted to eat there again ! When we came in the waiter came to us and said that his boss told him if we came to his restaurant again not to serve us !!! I dont know why ! He only said leave the restaurant!! That makes me feel terrible is it because of my hijab !!!! Is he racist!! Just dont eat there ppl! U feel really bad and the food not worth it
Stopped here for drinks when got to Ghent.. service was horrendous and ignored by the waiter several times. He was happier sat on his phone than serving customers. In the end we had a very pleasant young lady take our order.. Avoid to expensive for such poor service. 
"We were there for a family dinner with the 4 of us.Although I have no complaints about the quality of the food, the service we received was beyond normal. We ordered 4 entrees and 4 main courses.Things started off on the wrong food as the 2 cold main courses were served first (?) A bit later followed by 3 of the 4 entrees.Entree nr 4 never made it to our table.When we inquired about the strange order in which things were served, we were told that we had to mention explicitly that we wanted the entrees to arrive first (????)The other 2 main courses never made to our table.When we inquired about the missing main courses, it was obvious that this was totally forgotten. We received no excuses for that mishap at all.So we decided to leave the meal as it was (as it would take too long to get the 2 missing main courses).When we complained about the ruined family dinner, we got no excuses and no compensation was offered at all.How a professional waiter can forget 1 entree out of four, 2 main dishes out of 4 and serve things in the wrong order, is beyond me.My advise: stay out of this restaurant if you can. There plenty of other options in the neighbourhood"
"They lie about Their offer ""ribs at volonte"". They offer only a first plate of ribs and then, nothing more. If you ask your waiter for some more, he will ignore you. If you try to make a complain, the responsible will excuse and say that is because of the waiter, the cooker...This place is focused in tourism, only one time visitors, so the client satisfaction is not important for then."
"We went in this bar on a cold ghent sunday. There were not many in the bar nor few outside.But we sat and waited while the bar staff, and there were at least four of them, went about their business . Not one of them came near, or looked over to our seats. A chap and his girlfriend came in sat near us and gave up after about 5 minutes, while we stuck it out for about 15. A glasswasher near our bar area chatted to some new arrivals but made no attempt to get his mates to cover our neglected area. I have never thought to write a bad review, lets face it we all have off days, but this place gave an air of ""if you don't like it stuff it""It might have great beer but we will never know. The place across the road had 5 times as many customers but one bloke who was on the ball, always knowing what was happening at each table (t Galgenhuisje )Hells teeth, these waiters did not even look when I departed wih a few well chosen insults!"
"We went to have lunch at Nonna Stella on Saturday, 8 July to have lunch to the restaurant. A very unfriendly brunette short-haired waitress told us at 13:30 the kitchen was closing at 14:20. When we asked what were the ingredients of the mixed salad they were offering, she answered: ""mixed salad is mixed sala"". Given her attitude, we ate quick to leave the place as soon as we could. When we asked for the bill and I presented my card, the unpleasant waitress told us the card reader got broken the day before. When I told her she could have told us that before starting to eat she rudly reply: ""next time you go to a restaurant, you will ask first"". As unpolite as you can get. Obviously, we neither leave any tip nor we will go to that restaurant ever again. To the owner: la cameriera non parla nemmeno correttamente l´italiano."
Asked for a glass of water with breakfast and they said it was not allowed. The service is quite quick. Currently next to a building site.
"Very nice setting along the borders of the Leie. Waiters were unreasonably slow and even managed to bring the wrong wine. Cote à l'os needed to be ordered per two so we ordered for 6 people. We ended up getting 3 small slices of (very good) meat but only one bone with some additional slices. Pitiful. Only after complaining a lot did we get some additional meat. Overall, a very bad experience. We won't be back."
"Very unfriendly staff. We did not stay to try the food. No vegetarian options. And this was said to my partner in an agressive tone, with not even a smile in apology..and a condescending tone to ask us to close the door.. On our way out."
"We dropped in for a cocktail late afternoon/early evening. Just the worst service: slow, rude and unco-ordinated. Having taken 25 minutes to ask for our order for 2 pisco sours, when they arrived I was asked to pay immediately and note that I must know the table was booked in 55 minutes. Fine - but no more on the table. Then the batman had forgotten to add sugar to the drinks. Then having paid for our drinks we were asked to pay again by another waiter. Then the booking turned up 25 minutes early. With the best will in the world this is not an international bar; it a bar for the locals."
"Normally when you reserve through trip advisor at a certain time, the least you can expect is the kitchen to be open!!! We arrived at the restaurant at 8:40, of course after we reserved at noon through trip advisor, the hostess had no clue about the reservation and told us very sharply that the kitchen CLOSED 20 minutes ago!! The worst part is that no-one was able to take responsibility! There is absolutely nothing she could do! We simply left and went to another restaurant near by. Very disappointing!"
"Table reservation at 7.00pm, we arrived at 6.50pm and asked the waiter for the table. NO reservation was made. They forgot to add our names on the list. Good atmosphere for starters! After 20 minutes an impolite waiter came up with our appetisers. With barely a drop of liquid in our glasses and a rude behaviour, the atmosphere was created...Food was absolutely rubbish! The prawns drowned in an unidentifiable sauce and no bread was served. In between starters and the main dish, we noticed a foul sewer smell that ruined our appetite. The meat was not prepared the way we asked (medium). For a steak of this price, this is absolutely unacceptable. And a flavour of salt was spread out over the dish; Pepper sauce was too salty, meat was too salty, french fries were too salty. The accompanying salad was sprinkled with a sourish dressing that didn't taste good. And again... very rude service. Uninterested faces, a brutal way of serving the dishes and drinks. This restaurant is a joke! But a bad joke in this case. And ow... the desserts were covered in lots of sugar (sugar on the ice, sugar on the fruits, etc...). We decided to round up in a neighbouring café were the service was excellent. I suggest the personnel of ""De Lekkerbek"" takes a lesson from these people! It's not worth the money! There're better snack bars around than this pretentious restaurant."
"An Indian restaurant that does not make real paneer is not an Indian restaurant. Disgusting food. No authentic taste, just badly made."
"Possibly the worst meal I have had in my entire life. Also the only completely negative restaurant review I have ever written on Tripadvisor, which should tell you something. We ordered the mixed meze for two, which in every Turkish restaurant I've been to in the UK and Turkey itself is usually an interesting and tasty option. Two platefuls of mixed sludge arrived. The meal consisted of a series of icecream scoops of unidentifiable glop of various colours but all equally flavourless, plus a cold kebab made of small tough completely tasteless pieces of meat, and a larger single piece of some sort of meat product - equally cold and tasteless.We decided to pay up and go after a couple of mouthfuls. It proved difficult to find anyone willing to serve us, but finally someone came and removed our virtually full plates without any comment or query - maybe that speaks for itself.Such a shame - good Turkish food is fantastic, but this could put you off for life."
"Food was not good at all... Angus’ burger was definitely the worst burger I’ve ever eat.
At least, waitress was nice & friendly"
"First time ever in my life that i wasn't allowed to eat just a pizza.All we wanted was a pizza and the bartender claimed we couldn't order just a pizza, that we had to order a side food too... horrible experience we had to get a sad salad to make them win some more money. The restaurant was empty inside, consequence of such an embarrassing management. The pizza was average.Never coming back again."
"A disappointment, young and cool personnel but without attention for the customers. Busy handing out takeaway with a table of twelve waiting... and waiting. People listen carefully go somewhere else!!! Only two kinds of beer to chose from!? Come o you are in Belgium! What about the food? Over pepperd mash with balls filled with some pretentious tasteless crap...all of this enjoyed at 110 dB!"
"We came here for lunch. It was just matter of minute or two that we would have walked away from this place - as other reviewers, we noted the same. Place has potential customers but they seemingly are not interested to put some extra efforts for service and adding few waitresses/waiters - and we were not here during the high season. My Carpacio wasn't even that good, so in that sense it was a bit of a disappointment. My GF's salad was better. Next waiting point was to get the bill. And when that came they didn't accept the card!!! Had to go and find ATM,... Place has potential but with this experience, I really can't recommend this place for anyone, there are plenty neighbouring restaurants so please use them."
"It was so bad! The food was cold & wasn’t fresh, we all didnt like it and the service was so bad! It was an terible expierence and we dont recomand you to go to there! It was too expensieve and it was so bad"
"dirty kitchen, dirty toilets, not hygienic. I don't understand it is still existing"
"We made a reservation for this restaurant because the reviews on TripAdvisor are good but we sure regret it. When we arrived we weren't really sure about going in. The restaurant is small,cheap looking and full of delivery boys but we decided to try it anyways. There was no one to greet us and waited about 5 minutes. A woman came from the kitchen and we got a table. It took a long time to take our order and receive our drinks. I ordered a wan tan soup and fried udon with shrimp. My boyfriend mini loempia's and a chicken meal.Starters were good. My boyfriend got his meal. I waited about 10 minutes for mine. Never had that happen in a restaurant. The chicken was in small pieces but full of bones. The udon with shrimp. You get 3 shrimps. Meals are cheap so we were ok with it and it tasted good. Nobody picked up our plates and we had to wait a really long time to ask for the bill. 5 of the 6 tables in the restaurant were full and only one waitress. Service is slow and not good. You have to wait long for everything....But the worse thing is that both of us felt sick to our stomach after. My boyfriend spend the whole night in the toilet. So we don't think the restaurant is very hygienic.So a big thumbs down!!"
"I had dinner in this restaurant with two friends, one of us had noodle and me and a friend had Kimche, which was the specialty of their kitchen. The guy with noodle was happy but our food was very bad. The meat was not cooked well and in general, it did not taste at all. I could only finish my rice. We even could not find some salt or pepper on the table to add some spice on top of food. My friend puked after and I was about to do it. I think that some of 5 stars or 4 start here just fake and comments are a lie. I don't recommend it at all."
"Hi I was there last Thursday 8 to dinner. Poor service, lack of products displayed on the menu (generic beers) or fish soup.Picked, as second choice, a soup of tomato (water taste) despite claimed/ billed as creme. The escalope was a stuff very indigestible with suspicious smelling spaghetti as 'a side', I missed. Shame didn't pick a pizza because looked better, but no chance to give a second opportunity."
"Very dissappoited. We had made a reservation and mentioned that we would like to eat mussels. However, after we already ordered they came and said that they were sold out. They waitress (or maybe manager) was very rude and didn't even apologize. If you want to have a nice dinner with friendly athmosphere this is defenitely not a good choice."
"I want to warn you that it is not possible to pay with a VISA card, although it is stated that you can. The staff sent us very rude to cashmaschine to get money - horror! In addition, I left this same review on official FB page of Otoman Heavenly Pizza and they blocked me on the page and deleted the review -so funny! I am not sure if this is professional or not, decide on your own. Cheers."
"I was super keen to be organised for my trip to Gent so booked all the restaurants in advance. Confirmation emails saved I was looking forward to coming here on my first night. I'd even got an email 2 night earlier politely asking me not yo be late. I was very held up on Eurostar so had to race around to be ready and made it (thank you Google maps!) with a minute to spare. As we walked up to the door we were a little surprised at the tables stacked up outside and as we reached the door our hearts dropped as we saw it was all in darkness. A lovely electrician came and confirmed the place was closed but kindly recommend the restaurant Jus. The maitre D there couldn't have been more helpful. They were fully booked (it looked lovely mind you) and pointed us towards the Oud Clooster which was AMAZING. So much better than this would have been so we lucked out really. So if you are reading this considering this place, don't, go to Jus or the Oud Clooster instead."
"The boss of this place is a crazy rude man. We saw him yelling at people, at us. No reasoning at all, guess he was just ""angry"" because of the corona crisis. He made it everyone's problem. I will never ever set foot in this place again."
"I choose to not check trip advisor and go for the sunny spot at the square... Well, I shouldn't have. Ordered the steak as a lunch. 8 cm thick, tough as hell. Worst I ever ate. When I complained waiter told me I was the first one to complain (well, the others must have been very timid indeed). Avoid at all cost. "
"I will never never go back to this Pub. I visited with friends and we had an awful experience. The food that we ordered was lacklustre, dry, basic, and not very appealing at all. The cheese plate still have the marks of the staple in the fridge after we asked to change we got the same sticky cheese plate like staff just don't care . I order a draft Guinness and taste like was waiting for me from the day before!"
"This started so good - warm weather, order taken quickly at 13:00 - unfortunately it went downhill fast after that. Our starters took 30 minutes to arrive after we'd ordered, but with a noticeable gap between the first two plates and the last two plates. It then took a further hour for our main course to arrive. After we'd finished our main course (which was adequate, not gastronomic) we waited another hour to try to order dessert. Actually, we even waited an hour for the waiter to collect the plates.Finally at 16:00 we gave up trying to get any service and went to the cash desk to pay. There were two queues there. Diners who had given up waiting and just wanted to pay and would-be diners who had given up waiting for a waiter and wanted to order food. Next to the cash desk were a couple of hundred dirty glasses just stacked in plain view and behind the cash desk we could see at least one large sink full of dirty dishes - it appeared not only were the waiters not serving very quickly but the kitchen staff weren't bothering with the washing up.This wasn't our first visit, we'd chosen here because previous meals had been good, but we won't be going again. When we finally left after another 15 minutes the dirty plates were still on our table."
"The food was good, good price/quality ratio. Unfortunatily the service wasn't so good. The responsibles aren't clientfocused. 2 people were ill and we cancelled their reservation (on a total of a big group). Regrettably we received a bill for these people. We can understand that they expect a contribution, but we had to pay the WHOLE menu.... Unfortunatily the used reasons for this huge bill were not realistic. The responsibles really need a commercial education...Our regrets, but we'll never come back..."
"The worst experiences on a bar ever!At 11pm there is nothing to eat, no beer, only poor regular cocktels "
"We wanted to have lunch and went there after reading good reviews here. Our baby was sleeping in the stroller, and when we enter we realized that the place did not have much space for it. That would have been an honest response from the staff. Instead, the lady serving tables looked at one possible spot where to place us, and it seems she decided not to give us the table (it was for 6, we were just 2 adults). She then asked if we had reservation, which we didn’t, and then she said (very unfriendly) that she was sorry but everything was booked What a ridiculous answer! It was almost 1pm and half of the tables were empty, and none of the empty tables had a “reserved” panel on them. It was a very awkward situation, and therefore I would never recommend that place. It seems they have no manners to deal with customers. At the end we found another beautiful and family friendly place. They just lost a couple of customers."
I came with my parents to have a good meal and I was shocked by the Chef how impolite he was and believe that he’s customers are idiots I am a cook and now I work as a cocktail bartender in a 5 star hotel The food was bland no seasoning no care and the oil was not hot and my dad put the heat bigger and he got insulted by the Chef After trying the food we wanted to go home and cook by ourselves and we couldn’t take the food with us even if we payed for it Big waste of 110 € even is we didn’t used all the food I hope they lose their business 
"The service was incredibly slow - 40 minutes wait for a starter - then when it came it was just plain bad. The spinach and ricotta lasagne tasted of absolutely nothing, the waldorf salad was not, in any way, a waldorf salad and mostly consisted of a huge pile of chopped up cheddar and peanuts. Then they got the bill wrong by about 15 euros. On second attempt (with a calculator!) it was still over by 5 euros. Plus they charged us for tap water.Avoid."
"Told to sit anywhere, waited 15 minutes and no signs of n order being taken, walked out.  Shame cos the burgers are good."
"We were kicked out because we wanted ""only"" salad and pâté + drinks + dessert - although the restaurant was almost empty! Run away...not far there're much nicer spot (Brooderie for example) !!"
"Despite a friendly place, the quantities served are light. The waitress very awkward (I received all the hot chocolate dessert on my sweater!)
 It's very expensive for what you eat!
 There are other resturants in Ghent where you eat better with a lower price!"
"The service was horrible, the waitress was rude, made fling on the ordes we requested. The cafe and the hit chocolate was seems like an instant or so. Pizza was a normal standard one but all prices including the pizza was quite over priced. Surely not remmend this place :("
"We got to the restaurant early on a Sunday afternoon and it was already quite busy. The shocking thing was they only had 3 members of staff working. The waiter, the cook and a lady doing the drinks. In the end we waited 30 minutes for our food until we questioned where it had got to only to be told 30 minutes isn't an unreasonable time to wait. I'd imagine once it did turn up it'd have been cold as all the food was just stuck under the hotplate as the waiter couldn't cope with all the orders. Needless to say we just paid for the drinks and went. "
"On the website is mentioned that it is not possible to book an outdoor table.So we went overthere (20 min. drive) and even though there were still free tables on the terrace, we were told that there were only free tables indoor. The group of 5 people who arrived just in front of us, and who booked an indoor table, were assigned an outdoor table. The staff member lacked any form of politeness or elementary education and apparently didn`t even care. So we went to another restaurant (Het Moment in Nevele) and enjoyed a nice, cosy and tasty evening overthere. We will never come back to this place again."
"We had a business lunch with a party of five. Food and service were fine but nothing more. Pricing was really unacceptable! Bottle of water was only possible in 0,5 liter (6.50!). Apperativ glass of champagne was 12,-! Glass of house wine 7,-. These are prices you would expect in a two Michelin restaurant or on an A location and both weren't the case for sure. I feel ashamed to expense this. Use street view to see the location. "
"Terrible service! Hands down! Do NOT recommend! Enough said. Waited 10 minutes to receive a menu a table after being seated. Asked for bottled water that also took an additional 15 minutes. Not worth a dime this place. I ordered a lasagna and it was just a pool cheese with burnt edges. Disgusting staff, their all illiterate! Manager was very unprofessional when we offered our feedback to the staff's service. I was literally appalled - their lucky we still paid! Never again!"
On a not too busy Saturday night waited over an hour and a half for the bread before our meal. Even longer for our food which was ok but very expensive.
"We went to this place one afternoon after buying a christmas tree. So we were in a very forgiving mood. However, upon arriving with the kids (3 and 5), I have to say they looked abolutely un-enthusiastic about giving us a table (we hadn't made a reservation, but there was nobody there and during the course of the midday only few guests arrived). Friendly is apparently not in their dictionnary. Kids were being exemplary quiet and brave, having to keep themselves occupied in this place they designed for 'kindergarten', which is actually the cloakroom where they put some broken toys and incomplete puzzles. Top of the bill: the guy came over to our table to say that he found it quite irritating that the girls ran up and down the table and playing room. It ruined my day.I asked for a box to put the rest of the girls' pizza in, we got a sheet of alu foil...So they should work on family-friendlyness."
"The reviews of this place are plentiful and consistently excellent. We are British but live in Gent so we have considerable experience with Indian food - sadly in Belgium that can be a miserable experience!We had been to the Royal about 6 months ago and not enjoyed it but having seen the reviews decided to give it another chance tonight. It's a very cold night but the restaurant was full. There is nothing about the ambience which could be called pleasant, The table settings are minimal and for our two courses we had to use the same plates and cutlery but heh we were there for the food. As starters we had vegetable samosas and vegetable soup. The samosas were fine, a bit lukewarm and identical to ones we have bought from an Indian takeaway a few hundred metres away but OK. The soup was not pleasant and had a very floury taste. For mains we had lamb palak and my wife had lamb rogan. the quality of meat in each dish was identical - horrible. We both managed a mouthful and then we couldn't swallow any more. It tasted like very old badly cooked mutton, the rogon sauce in particular tasted like the chef had been bilinfolded and simply been given raw chilli to choose from. Wwe wanted the bill - told the lady host why and she simply shrugged her shoulders.. She then asked did we want to pay cash which is often Belgian code for...... When we got the bill which we paid by card and she tried to charge us for 4 starters and at no point even suggested some form of compensation for leaving our mains.entirely.Oh by way of a bonus the lad waiter managed to put his thumb into most of the food he served to us - no it didn't improve the taste!So one of the worst Indian meals we have had for a long time. Maybe we were just unlucky, or maybe the amazing reviews are ......... You decide but have a sandwich in your pocket!"
"Food was terrible. Bread was old came from the freezer....sure, We odered a medium/rare grilled Chateaubriand but it was dry and like rubber. Same for the grilled Tuna it was dry and tasteless. Although the waiter said it will be grilled on both sides for a short time. Sure this Tuna was pre grilled and came from the fridge. After we complained the waiter responded: see what I can do. So another waiter came to tell us that if it is put on the grill again it will be more dry! What an answer! No sorry....nothing. Also our empty bottle of wine was taken away without any question. Never again this place. Bad Food and Bad service."
"I usualy don’t give negative reviews but this has been a very bad experience.This used to be a very good restaurant but there are new owners now. The quality of the food is just terrible. I would rather eat Mc Donalds then go back there.The restaurant is dirty, the staff doesn’t greet you when you enter or thank you when you leave. This is really a shame and a big waste of money. "
I can summarize my visit in one word: Horrible. The beef was so undercooked it started eating the salad. My water glass was stained with lipstick and had bits of food floating in it. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE!'
"We dined at the Lucy Chang restaurant in Ghent last Sunday and the food - and I won't mince my words - can only best be described as utterly appalling, I wish I could say different. Our Dim-sum was a complete mash of sticky mess - dilapidated yuck!. It came plastered to the basket that housed it. Eating it required us to peel and prize it from the bottom of the container. Despite all our efforts to keep the pieces intact, it simply fell apart. People from other tables peaked at our meal, and screwed up their faces echoing our disappointment. The problem was that we had to endure the task of eating it, and pay for it ! Okay, presentation aside, it was a poor representation of dim-sum; it tasted ghastly. I needed to quickly wash my down the first (and the last piece) with gulps of Cava which, I might add, was served in a none too clean glass!Our main dishes were equally slap-dash and shoddily prepared. Firstly, our main course arrived as the starter. Realizing the mistake, the waitress returned the main course to the kitchen, and when we were ready to continue with our meal, re-presented it. During this time, while it was being 'kept warm' it was obviously drying out and when it made its second reappearence, arrived only really fit for the bin. I mailed the branch in Ghent, complaining about our experience and waited a week for a response. I explained that I had chosen to contact them first before posting my comments on trip advisor, appreciating that posting negative comments on Facebook, or any social media site, might damage custom, and I wanted to avoid this. But the team at Lucy Chang in Ghent did not respond. I've interpreted their non-response to be in keeping with the terrible 'meal' we had. But readers should know, we did not, and I repeat, DID NOT enjoy our meal. I DO Not recommend eating at this resto, you will be wasting your hard-earned money."
"Too small portions, very basic dinner, disappointed overall. Size of main course is like a starter. Restaurant is mainly interesting for beer lovers, lot of beers and very limited menu card."
"Went for breakfast this morning with thought of reading the paper on the ipad. But hey ho, in 2013 their WIFI is only available for guests staying overnight! Upon making a remark about it I was told i could leave if i wanted to. Should have done so. Breakfast was meager and expensive for what you get. Add to that the arrogance of staff and management, suddenly one of nicest locations in Ghent looses all its charm!"
"After some negative experiences, we gave it another chance, as we'd heard about a new management. Not much has changed for the better, though. Just ordering a few beers on the terrace was daunting. Dirty, wobbly table, slow service, and when we made a remark, we got a rude, arrogant reply of the waiter. Courtesy?"
We stopped for a cosy coffee/tea in the sun. Tea glasses were half-filled only. Questioning this we were told this is normal.
The service was so unfriendly and rude! The waffle was mediocre. Overall really bad experience! I would definitely not recommend this place!
"I went to Cassis with my husband. He had mussaka, I had lasagna. Both looked like poorly reheated supermarket food - swimming in bubbling, cloying cheese which was burnt around the edges. The lasagna tasted no better then supermarket food - the mussaka was so poor my husband couldn't eat it. Although we complained the attitude of the staff was totally dismissive and we were charged full price. Nice location so it is probably what is known as a tourist trap."
"Not only was the so called ""normal size"" freaking small, but it was even fried! 9 euros for a pizza that is not even considered a baby pizza in Italy!!! Don't go there!!! They are crazy!!!! They don't even deserve a single point."
Ordered for a family of 4. Sat for an hour and had to ask about food.  Order was never processed.  It wasn’t busy.  Sent away with no food.  I wouldn’t recommend.
"This restaurant looks OK from outside; however, the inside is smell, badly illuminated, on a hot day don't even try it... anyway, the tables, chairs are low quality... they packed the place with tables; there is even one near the stairs going to the restroom... very dangerous... public inspectors should drop by. The food is salty, not fresh, not tasty at all. Personnel: unfriendly to hell. In particular the old guy who seems to be the one running the place. A few of the waiters had brains.Toilets: in case you made the mistake in going to this restaurant after reading this note and had to go to the toilet, take a long breath otherwise you will faint due to the smell...In summary, the best you can do: run away from it and look for another place."
"This place has awful coffee, it taste like nothing... my friend asked a matcha latte and she received a cup of milk, she told them, I don't taste any macho...the reply was: yes there is matcha inside...( We even wander if they know what matcha is).Some of the waiters and waitresses are very rude and. They sometimes let you wait very long and when you dare to comment on this, you will be completely ignored.In the winter it is cold. Never go again."
"Very rude service! The restaurant has been there for a very long time so we expected a bit better than what we experienced. The food is so so, expensive and nothing special but the service is unacceptable. Me and my friend were still eating and the waitress just came to our table, throw the knifes and forks to the plates and took a way. She didn’t ask if we finish. Her attitude is very unpleasant for such a nice place like Pakhuis. I guess you would’t care about my review but if you keep going with this standard of service, you would loose your reputation. Avoid at all costs if you don’t want to ruin your day. There are many more nicer places to go in Gent. Don’t waste your money! "
"The owner/manager was so disagreeable we didn’t get to eat. He was very patronising, when we questioned why there was rocquefort in the fondue, he said he couldn’t take it out . We asked to sit around a table in a certain way but he said it was impossible. We left , totally awful service!"
"Visited Vaudeville on weekend of Ghent festival, booked a table for 7.30pm and did not get out of restaurant until after 9.30pm which was not by choice. Service was extremely slow and staff were very rude and unhelpful blaming a busy restaurant on the delay. Complained to what appeared to be the manager to be treated with the worst attitude. The dessert was thrown on the table with nothing but rudeness when we asked if we could not wait so long as we did for the main meal. The bill was totalled up incorrectly. I found the food was lovely but the attitude was inexcuseable and very unprofessional. Ghent is a great city but this restaurant does not appear to grateful for its customers. Would not go there again."
"I went there with a group of friends, but we were badly treated since the start. It took 20 minutes to get our orders collected by a waitress that didn't spoke English and was super rude completely for free with our group. I dont recommend this place for anyone."
Sightseeing tour in beautiful Ghent with only an hour for lunch. We sat and waited 25 minutes for the waitress to take our order. Lunch arrived 20 minutes after that. When the bill arrived we were charged for additional waffles we did not order. Waitress insisted we pay for the additional waffles. Ordered and received two coffees and one waffle with a total cost €26. Other people on our tour also overcharged for food at this cafe. Terrible service and over priced. 
"We went to this restaurant as we saw its rating was good. The owner took our orders which was 4 mains and drinks. He insisted on taking the orders altogether in order to serve us quickly, so we ordered even though our wives were in the restroom. We were served one dish and drinks after 15 minutes. The rest of the orders did not come for another hour! Meanwhile, the next tables who had come after us, had their dinner and left. Upon asking politely, we were told very rudely that since we ordered starters, we have to wait for the main course. We had ordered only the main courses! As we protested, we were asked to leave, which we did after paying for what we had consumed partly. Totally horrible experience and deplorable service. Would give this place minus rating even if it served Michelin starfood."
Ordered drink and two cheese croquettes - the food arrived before the drinks but we had no cutlery. Waitress said she would bring cutlery but after 5 minutes had to go look for some as could see she was clearing tables elsewhere. Went back to eat and flagged down staff asking for drinks - was told they would come. After another 5 minutes still no sign so found another waitress to ask and was told if we wanted them we'd have to go inside and ask for them there! They should perhaps advertise themselves as a self service restaurant. Wouldnt return or recommend to others.
"First of all, the staff was unfriendly. It felt like smiling was hard. Secondly, although noticed up front I was intolerant to milk, they did not took it in count. I received the same menu but without milk, no alternatives. Furthermore, it was completely overpriced. There are a lot of other nice places in Ghent where you have better quality and service for a less or the same price. Don't waste your time and money in this restaurant. "
The waiter made us feel uncomfortable and he was the rudest waiter I have ever met and if it was not for children being present I would of had a very serious talk with him. If the owner is reading this get rid of the male waiter with glasses working at 3p.m on Saturday 22nd February 2014 he is terrible.
The locatIon of this pizzeria is great but that's where it stops.A typical tourist trap where they serve up so called italien rubbish thinking that us the paying customer is stupid and at hugely inflated prices We ordered 2 Cannalonis which was tasteless and cold. In spite of telling the waiter he insisted we had to pay. I could not believe how rude the staff were. Eventually they accepted we only had to pay for the water. Looks very nice location wise from the canal but please do not get sucked into it
"We visited this restaurant with our baby. We asked for a table but no one actually responded, it was a very unfriendly welcome. We were then directed to sit outside, we selected a table but the waiter said we were not allowed to sit there because they are not gonna serve whilst other people were already sitting there. She directed to a table where people were smoking.... We were so shocked by this unfriendly welcome that we decided to leave."
"Waiters with no experience, hard bread, expensive prices. A total deception.  Run if you see this site"
"Very strange experience, we went to the restaurant with 5 people during Gent festivities which is a top period for restaurants, to our surprise we were told the cook ran away for the evening shift so they couldn't serve anything, normally this restaurant should be packed at this time but was completely empty. Never had this experience but maybe it has to be the first time for everything ?"
"The pasta was very dry and badly reheated. No tomato sauce at all. No taste. I thought no one can go wrong with a basic pasta, but apparently I'm wrong."
"Nice appearance and location, even if right by the red light district. New restaurant. Staff service okay. Food not so good.Chateaubriand on hot stone just boiled away rather than browned and seared. Beef ended up tough and flavourless. American burger was more like steak tartare, very raw. Boeuf stroganoff tasted like no other stroganoff. Undercooked onions, tough meat, flavourless and unseasoned sauce, with cold spaghetti. Refused tap water. Left quickly after paying.If a restaurant is empty on a Saturday night, there's probably a good reason."
I can summarize my visit in one word: Horrible. The beef was so undercooked it started eating the salad. My water glass was stained with lipstick and had bits of food floating in it. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE!'
"De Superette get off your pedestal ! K.Desramaults needs to start eating at his own place, too busy with other projects, not doing quality control. REALITY CHECK. He would realize his staff snotty attitude, the ok food not worth the price and the bad faces on all the customers around. 35 euros for just eggs, potatoes and wood fire bread + 5 euros for tea + 3.50 euros for water. Believe me I got ripped off, avoid making the same mistake as I did. There is so much better in Ghent, in Belgium, in Europe.... PASS"
"The terrace was not packed but we did not even get as far as to ordering anything. Waiter didn't see us, or ignored us, so we waved when he looked our way. He then came to us telling us that it was very condensending of us to wave to him like that. We replied that he could be more friendly and we did not mean the waving to be condensending. He then just turned around and did not service us.We went to see the 'manager' but he just stood there while the waiter yelled at us. We explained what happened but the waiter went as far as to deny everything and said we just started abusing him for being slow. When there was no reaction from the 'manager' we decided to leave.Horrible waiter and horrible management, avoid at all costs."
"In the past we had great food in Patrick Foley's, but this weekend 3 out of 4 dishes were simply bad. The burgers were dry, overcooked. The cheese and bacon were also dry. It seemed like yesterdays burgers, reheated. Instead of the Tierentyn mustard promised on the menu there were pickles out of a jar on the burger. A friend of ours had the vegetarian curry. The sauce was cold and the whole dish tasted like nothing but saffron. The goat cheese salad was ok.The place was empty on a sunday, lunchtime. A moment where not that much restaurants are open and everything is packed in Ghent."
"I definitely like eating well and enjoy new concepts. My kids really like Balls & Glory so I decided to try it but I am definitely not impressed. OK, the concept is nice but it is nothing more than a fast-food in a modern coat. The meat balls are filled with meat, vegetables or fish and you get smashed potatoes with it. And that's about it. You stay there max 30 minutes and you' re gone. Definitely better and healthier than Mc Donald's but it is not a culinary experience as some people say.My food was also not really hot and the taste was bland. Can definitely be better."
Several colleagues suggested to try it .. big disappointed.. salade had sand in it and was not well washed .. come on guys thats the basic of cooking .. the spare ribs were really bad marinated.. just grilled spareribs with some spice on it .. was actually not marinated.. dont know why my colleagues liked it but seems that there is a new chef or they dont care anymore.. service was good and they tried there best .. will not go back.. 
"Despite the good name of ""de Kastart"" regarding spaghetti dishes, we were greatly disappointed today in the quality of the vegetarian version of their spaghetti Bolognese. This dish consists of classic pasta, combined with heavily sweetened sauce that seemed to come out of a bottle bought at a Chinees grocery shop, without any fresh vegetables. The dish was finished with some cheese on top.My friends and I were sick afterwords."
Do not wear mouth mask correctly. Sometimes they don't wear ... Wrong order and extremely expensive.
Calzone burnt on the outside but uncooked on the inside. Waiter unfriendly. Place is outrageously expensive
"So we were looking for a nice place to eat out with a couple of friends. It seemed a bit on the pricier side, but since it had been a while since we went out, why not? And the place had a pretty good score.We arrived early.. One of the first tables. We started with some drinks, had small bite and then a main course.The drink tasted very watery. The bite was fairly expensive for such a small serving.The steak just made me sad. I ordered a medium rare tenderloin (filet pure). I received a fairly cold piece of seared raw, tough meat. Adding to the disappointment was the fact that despite our early arrival, we waited quite a long time for the main course. Most of the other tables were already having coffee or dessert.Oh well.. I ordered an Irish coffee to cheer me up. It tasted like they forgot the whisky though.When we asked for the ticket, we noticed several mistakes in the pricing. Some drinks were more expensive on the ticket than on the menu. The friendly lady went to sort things out for us after apologizing and scrapped one of the drinks as compensation. The new ticked had the correct numbers, but no scrapped drink to be seen. After inquiring with her co-worker, we got nothing but mockery and some eye rolling.Long story short, no tips here. This was my first restaurant visit where I payed the exact amount shown on the ticket. They won't see us again."
"We waited more than one hour for our food to come, and there were only 4 other people in the restaurant. When the food finally came, the portions were so small, we all left hungry. In the end we paid 90 euros for 2 fried rices, 2 noodles, 3 soda drinks and 2 appetisers. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"We went to try this resto for a quick burger. At first sight it looked ok and tasted not bad, but then my son opened the burger. The meat was completely black. It was burned like hell. We tried to slice the black part of the burger, but we ended up with no burger anymore. I chrcked mine and it was the same thing. Although I could save somewhat of my burger and shared it with my son. Still we were dissapointed and left without finishing... This was our last time there. Next time we want a burger we go to Leuven in the Burger folies."
"The main, a beef filet was nearly well done instead of medium rare, they offered to take it back, but I am not willing to wait another 30 min. Finally the dish was fully charged on the bill!!!The rest was good and the atmosphere nice, but 70 Euros for a piece of rubber - enough is enough!"
We'd seen this venue from a boat trip and it looked like a lovely spot for a drink. Despite the dire recent reviews we thought we'd give it a go at 2.45pm on a Saturday afternoon when it was practically empty. After a couple of minutes of loitering near the bar we were told it was a restaurant only and not for drinks. The same waiter then promptly told two other couples the same thing. We all left. Never to return. Pompous and unfriendly. 
"I’ve been here a couple of times to get a flat white to take away, and every single time the milk has been overheated and full with bubbles. In overheated I mean boiling hot. A good barista coffee has velvety smooth warm milk. These girls really need to take some barista classes as they are serving ruined coffee. Also extremely overpriced for the quality they serve. Not coming here again there are better coffee places in town."
"Very poor restaurant. Jacked potato was old and dry, aspargus dish is dissapointing (terrible sauce) and the special house burger has nothing special at all, very below average. Service super slow! "
Regular food. Regular service and definitely NOT great. Knokke is a beautiful tourist town and they don't even accept visa or a bank card. What does that say in terms of what they think about tourists?!
Very bad. Literally bad. Wanna enjoy gent do not go there. Unfriendly dirty and expensive. The waiter working there doesn't look you in the eyes. Very sad.
Restaurant decoration look nice but don’t get fool by the outlook. We have ordered burger and salmon fillet. When is comes salmon was over cook and the side dish was a joke and the price charging me 25 Euro for that dish. For the burger I can buy cheaper than 19 Euro for Asia Macdonald and even more tasty than 19 Euro burger. Regret to drop by such a restaurant. 
Looking at the other reviews I was probably unlucky but my experience with this place was not great. I had the soup of the day which was ok and the pasta with mushrooms and bacon which was more than disappointing. What really ruined the experience was the fact that in order to pay my bill I had to go and get cash from the closest ATM as their payment terminal was not working and they did not accept card payments.
This restaurant is most expensive of all restaurants in gent . Absolutely small portion for the price asked . Over cooked meat and the tenderness in chicken was missing. This restaurant is aimed for tourists seeing the price as they are on higher side . Located on a street known for restaurants. Would t recommend to anyone as we paid almost a fortune for two persons which I think is on a higher side for Indian food . Guys cut down the prise or increase portions .
"We visited here for lunch. It was all you can eat pizza, but it is only during certain hours. We had about an hour left before it stopped.We had to wait 5 minutes for a table and then was shown to a table upstairs, and informed the waitering staff up here would come to us shortly.We waited and waited and after about 20minutes decided to go get the pizza from the all you can eat section. When we arrived at the section nearly all the pixies had gone and there was a queue waiting for the new pizzas to arrive. This took a long time and then they brought out a simple pizza at a time.Back up stairs with what pizza we managed to get, a member of staff eventually came to take our order and saw that we had already gone to get the pizzas to eat. They then told us that we should have waited, and when we informed them that we had already waited 25mins in total so far and that there was only just over 30minutes left to the buffet they shut up. Clearly if we waited for them by the time we went for the buffet it would be finished. We ordered are drinks and when they arrived they brought us the wrong drinks.Seriously the staff have no idea in this place. Service was shocking, as was the buffet. Avoid this place."
"Unfriendly personeel..food was cold,worse experience ever....would never recommend it to anyone...bad services and very rude lady......second food came after 30 minutes and it tasted soo bad and was few.we had to share with my cousins the first food....rude lady and I tried to tell her that we were not happy with the services and respond don't come again other people will come....Worse restaurant ever I visited in my entire life."
We showed up there with the family first thing the server said because we were speaking in French was Flemish only what he did not know was that we speak Flemish too. From there it went downhill server did not come back for another 10 minutes.At that point we decided to go to Dulle Grier a few doors down the street and it was amazing.Oh well first bad experience ever in over 4 stays in Belgium .....
"It is such a pity that beautifully located places like this employ staff that think they can treat customers so badly.I guess it’s because they can, tourists put up with it. They location is good and it looks like a lovely place to spend some time. Given the tourist turnover, they clearly don’t give a damn about how the staff treat people.Myself and my partner tried to order two drinks when we visited this week. The waitress was very disinterested and seeing we weren’t sure what to order, decided to call back later. After about twenty minutes of watching her walk by, looking the other way, we got the message. We decided that as we were not paupers and had good jobs, and were educated and polite and hardworking, that it probably wasn’t a good idea to sit there and be ignored by a clearly very disinterested staff. We walked off and found somewhere else.In conclusion. I suppose this kind of thing happens a lot in Belgium, where customer service is the bottom of the pile, but it was a horrible way to treat two people who just wanted to spend a few euros there. If you are thinking of visiting there, and read this review, then all I can do is inform you of our experience.I’d go elsewhere, and until visitors report bad service, and vote with their feet, places like this will continue to treat customers like some kind of burden.Shame on that waitress for the terrible service, we will never meet again, but the memory of Belgian hospitality will endure. You have been informed everyone."
"Order taken quickly and cheesy croquettes arrived quickly and were very good. Down hill after that. Main courses arrived 45 minutes after starter finished. Tortellini was superheated in the centre and rubbery pasta, classic microwave job. Chicken Vol-au-vent lukewarm and mediocre and certainly not worth the wait. Menu warned not to complain about slow service or once your plate was empty, but after a 45min wait for pasta, I wasn't risking waiting another 45. Go elsewhere, much better and cheaper food at other restaurants nearby. "
"We booked a table for 2persons at 8pm for Feb 14th.The table behind us was a group of 10 very loud speaking guys, not a good idea to combine this especially when you know the acoustic is very bad. But then came the worst, after ordering we had to wait for nearly 1h to have the starters (mix of starters, 1 plate for both of us, nothing difficult to prepare) , and then another additional 2hours (!!) to get the principal meal, also the same for both of us.This meal was also a mix of 3 small dishes without heater which means your first dish is warm but the 2 others are cold. Conclusion : I would not recommend this place, there are much better places to eat Thaï. It’s the first time reality didn’t absolutely not match with the Tripadvisors reviews. But for us there will be definitely no 2nd visit there."
"first of all, we came and made a reservation in person and asked for a table outside! surprisingly when we arrived they put us inside and the host even tried to blame us if we reserved by telephone! not polite and not professional at all. At the end we have got the table but at the very end of the upper hall. very disaapointed!!!! Then we ordered the food at 19.30 but we received our food at 21.00, 2 hours of waiting!!! Honestly, the quality of food was not that good. We understand that there were a lot if people but we think the service could be done better........."
"We were told that Amadeus restaurant had amazing ribs. We just spent a night in Ghent and we did not have a reservation. When we tried Amadeus restaurant, the manager told us that they had opened recently another restaurant. Same ribs, same owner, same everything. He forgot to mention that it was not at all the same experience that we would get. The local is peculiar. Looks something between like an old bar and an old library. I did like the ambience and deco even though it's a bit kitsch, still smells like dust. Regarding service, it was TERRIBLE. I can't really express how much time it took them to place our order, to serve us 4 biers (45minutes) and to actually put the food on the table (1h10min!!!). There were only 2 waiters for a pretty big restaurant, with no organization at all. They didn't know which table they took care of, who ordered already, who was waiting for food. Obviously, there was also a lack of personnel in the kitchen. Our ribs got to the table half cold already! And I must say the quality of the food was not extraordinary given the price. And if you want to pay with card, you have to walk to another of their restaurants in the corner. I was really really disappointed and they have to change something fast or this place will not survive."
For 51e for a steak i expect star-kitchen. They didnt told us the price of the suggestion... so we were unexpected of the sugg
"Terrible visit while staying nearby: staff were rude, kept getting our order wrong (we ordered the set breakfast and juice arrived 20 min after food, egg 40 min after main plate and wrongly cooked..). My food arrived 30 min after my partner's, and items were forgotten (no milk, juice forgotten etc)But worse than all this was the aggressively rude and unapologetic staff. One to avoid unfortunately! "
"We booked by e-mail but when arriving there was no record of our reservation despite having received a confirmation from the restaurant. The attitude of the owner's wife was terrible, telling us we didn't have a reservation, coming up with different stories (e.g. that our hotel had cancelled the reservation even though we hadn't booked through the hotel) and not listening to anything we said. A real attitude problem which made us glad that we didn't end up eating there!"
"Worst dinner ever for an expensive price. The spare rips are super boney and dry. The sauces are chemical & have no natural flavor . Who knows where the rips are from? Mass animal husbandry?Cheese croquettes did not taste like cheese, more like chemical powder. Disappointing!The restaurant looks nice & the staff is friendly. But the food is not good. "
We tried this new restaurant in gent . Probably the worst indin food in Gent Ordered the tandori chicken was nothing like tandori chicken .Was more like some chicken from Mc donalds Tasteless I orderd the lamb madras also very bad there was very little meat and it was extremely Fatty also no taste .All i can say is if the belgians think this place is good they have no idea what really good indian food is . My advice is dont waste your money here
"I've visited Salt N Pepper countless times for years, as i live just around the corner. Since a few years the food, service and treatment of customers went downhill. First of all: patience is the key: waiting times of hours is not an exception. Last time only 6 tables were taken still it took them 30 minutes just to serve our drinks. The 'lassi' was just some warm milk with a bit of taste but nothing compared to a real lassi. The beer was hot and had no foam..a disgrace in Belgium! Also they didn't want to serve us some tap water to go along with our food: being a steady client for years: utterly stupid..now you lost a client who could potentially spend thousands there. Staff is extremely rude and unfriendly.Then another hour until we got our food..very weird with 2 people serving for 6 tables. Once we got our food, the taste is nothing compared to what it used to be. Very dry rice, no taste in the food.On top of that they tried to rip us of on the bill, and this has happened several times: so be extra careful when you get your bill. They charged us 3 lassi's while we just had 2.Next to the systematical 'mistakes' in their bills, the food is insanely expensive for what you get..in other words: POOR."
"We were 4 people and all plates are disastrous, especially mine! I ate boiled chicken with potatoes as their special!!"
"AVOID! Sushi was old (day before), you could taste the dried-out rice. Just not worth the belly-problems afterwards. Moreover it was freezing in the restaurant, they didn't put on the heating at all. Decoration is very sloppy too with unfinished painted walls and bright TL-lights, not cosy at all. Unfortunately, lost all is glory since new owners."
"Came in for a weekend breakfast. From the time when they had just opened, I remembered them as a place where you got that little bit of extra luxury. This is clearly not the case anymore. Though the setting is lovely and unique, right up to the staff's outfits, service was impersonal and disorganised. Waiting time was extremely long (20 mins to place my order and another 20 for a beverage). Admitted: the eggs were delicious and the juice is truly fresh, but the food dissapoints.The salmon is served with raw onions (NOT a very graceful morning-ingredient), though the menu says it is served with dille. The lemon was brown and the pancakes were dry, served with nothing but some powdered sugar, which comes across as very cheap (they used to be served with maple syrup or whipped cream). I also shared this with the staff, but they merely stated 'it is not on the menu anymore' without suggesting a supplement or alternative. Maybe they cracked under the weight of tourism or succes, as sadly often happens in Ghent, but I'm defenitely not returning there."
"A person in our company is allergic to gluten: he made sure to inform the waiter and asked explicitly for a gluten-free dish. The dish arrived with... couscous (which hadn't been mentioned on the menu). When politely informed, the waiter reacted extremely rudely. Since december all Belgian restaurants are obligated by law to be able to inform customers about allergens, but the waiter curtly proclaimed he didn't take note of that. We were all shocked at the way the situation was handled. (My own food, by the way, was very bland.)"
"We had a farewell party of a friend tonight so we wanted to celebrate it just having a dinner in Amadeus II near Belfort. Everything was normal, I have been in Amadeus lots of time so everything was aparently as always and we were having a really good dinner.The problems arrived when we were going to pay the bill, one of us saw a mouse near the bathroom corridor. After we paid the bill we wanted to report this issue to the manager of tonight's service. He just only didn't trust us, and with really impolite manners he forced us to go out from the local and ''to come back to our country'' (we are not belgians but I think this behaviour on a manager must be forbidden, moreover when the manager himself is not belgian too). After that we wanted to ask for a complaint letter in the local but they didn't want to give us one so we just go away.Seriously, because things like this I would like to think that this was only a special situation but I couldn't believe it. Even if you don't trust a customer's telling you that she has seen a mouse you can't treat her like that and forcing 15 customers to abandon the place on that way.I won't come back again. and I invite all the people that, if they want to go to Amadeus just go to the other 3 restaurants in the city."
"Popped in for lunch attracted by the lovely private terrace. Ordered the fixe prixe lunch. Starters came fairly quickly and were fine. Mains took nearly 45 minutes to come out. Fish main was an utter joke - a fish ""fillet"" of literally 2"" x 2"" and a few spinach leaves drowned in a white sauce. Extremely expensive & bad value. Avoid! "
"We waited for more than an hour and our food didn't arrive. We even notified the service that we had been waiting for a long time, but after more than an hour waiting we left after paying the drinks and the nachos, the only thing that we tasted."
"We have reserved a table for 4. We then informed the restaurant as one friend got sick and told them that we are only 3 now. We think that is the correct way to act.When arriving at the restaurants there were a couple of tables available. The head waiter gave us a table not even big enough for two with three high stools. You certainly could not put dishes and silverware for three there.When asking for a decent table this gentleman acted absolutely rude and unprofessional. He avoided eye contact and definitely has not got the slightest idea of the basics of service. Our advice: If you want to be treated with some respect do not go there. ,"
Those kind of restaurants that don’t let you go to the service if you are not consuming. Very disappointing. The waitress was impolite
"In the UK Indian restaurants are a guarantee for tasty affordable food. This place wouldn't last a month in any British town or village. Completely tasteless food, no spices at all. The rice is very dry and extremely bland. Lamb could just as well be cheap beef or even pork. Furthermore it's really expensive and they are unfriendly bordering on arrogant. Please be warned this place is a fraud and and insult for Indian food. I know there aren't much alternatives in Ghent but you're better off having a bag of chips or eat at one of the many decent restaurants Ghent is rich of which many are Asian and offer great value for money."
Place was jamming by 6 pm already: pizzas are great but service very rude. Expect to be ready within 45 min and be prepared to be kicked out for the next service. Won’t see me again
Very bad welcome ( they didn't even look at as when they told us there was no place in the next minutes). The girl was shocked when i old here it would be nice if she could look to her customers and be friendly. So never go there ! We went to the Belga Queen Restaurant where we were invited nicely at the bar to wait for a table.
"service was done by 1 person only, friendly lady although she seemed very rushed.small springroll was tasty, seaweed salad was tasty and tempura prawns not bad, although the batter was quite big.main course:sweet and sour fish dishchicken wok with vegetableswhen the main course was served i could not believe my eyes:the sweet and sour dish was covered with loads of grated cheese?????? (21euro!!!)the chicken wok with veggies had a deepfried chicken filet on top filled with cheese???I am not sure when cheese became part of the japanese food culture.... very odd and not appetising! i am not going back ever again!"
I had heard so much about this overhyped rib place and was extremely disappointed in every aspect. the ribs were stringy and tough the service was non-existent and the drink selection was ridiculously slim.  ribs and beer in Bruges Belgium is what you want.
"I am a pizza lover but claiming authentic italian and baking in a gas oven?Quality of the pizza's was awfull...low on tomato and cheese.. In addition one Pizza had a crunchy bottom, one was cold and 1 other was mega warm.There are better places for pizza in Gent: il cortile, al castello,...AND No COCA COLA or other soft drinks available;"
"The food was great, but that was some of the worst service I've ever experienced. First they seated is and forgot about us, finally after about 20 min of waving we got a menu, but then completely ignored for another 20. Finally we got in our order and the drinks took another 20 min to come. And the coke was a tiny glass of watered down fake coke. We got a second round of drinks and I had to ask three times to two waiters. Finally got them. It's all you can eat, but good luck getting their attention for more."
It is the very first time I don't have much to say about a place.A particular guy (staffmember) was rude and arrogant. The seats were not clean at all. The food was below average and the drinks... low quality.We've payed a lot of money for what we've had.We went to another place to have our dessert and coffee !For us... never again.
"Food is good but the service was really terrible, unfriendly and arrogant. The waitress was saying literally in hearing distance: "" They just sitting here and doesn't order anything""."
"The location is great! But the service is amazingly horrible :( I ordered a ceasar salad without chicken and that was a HUGE problem, because quoting the waiter, he didn't want to make the cook crazy. A friend ordered a vegetarian meal and the vegetables were cold and full with oil. The food is way too expensive and you have the smallest portion in your life. This restaurant was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant."
I can summarize my visit in one word: Dreadful. My shoes were stained with rat droppings after leaving this place. The center of my steak was so frozen it started singing 'Let It Go.' Overhyped. 1 star. Never again.
We ordered mussels today for lunch and we shared it( two people). Yet the personnel didnt inform us about the additional costs the shared dish would imply. Definitely not transparent at all because I would want to pay for sharing the dish extra costs without even being informed!! The owner refused to acknowledge their fault. Very rude and unprofessional attitude. Definitely do not recommend and never coming again.
"Terrible experience altogether. The waiter who served us wasn't polite enough, the price is way too high for the food and service that you get, and if you want to drink water be prepared to pay no less than 9 euros for a 1L bottle, which is what they charged me. Unbelievable and unacceptable. Would never return for all the money in the world. The waiter gave me a silly explanation. A restaurant that does this to a visitor to Ghent can't be trusted and simply give this city a bad name. Shame on them."
"We went here to enjoy a Pizza in Gent before our son travels back for his studies. We all ordered a Pizza and were shocked when it arrived. With an average price of 15 Euros, this was a complete abomination. The pizza was extremely small with very little sauce and was very dry. The buffalo mozzarella was not true fresh mozzarella, which we would know, having come to Italy for over 30 years. When our concerns were raised with the restaurant owner, he became extremely angry and uncontrolled, shouting in French and refusing to speak the native language of Flanders, Dutch. Trying our best to communicate in French, he became even angrier, did not offer to improve the pizza and demanded we pay the entire bill or he would call the police. Never coming again, this is a disgrace to Italian hospitality and the lovely city Ghent."
"If I could leave 0 stars I would. First, the food descriptions were very frou-frou and the prices very expensive. Second, after being seated we waited about 5 minutes for menus, then nothing. No one asked us about drinks or what we'd like to eat. After being totally ignored by the entire wait staff (who were not at all busy with customers, but had plenty of time to gather at one end and chat), we left. Worst experience we've had in our entire stay in Belgium. Avoid this place."
"No sandwiches, only warm expensive salads. Paid 4.60 for some potatoes. First time, last time! Now to go find some food somewhere else."
"We just ordered basic stuff, but we had to wait long time to get our order ready. Food was not that good.. very poor.. i have always told how tasty the Belgian ""frits"" are. At this venue they were cold. 
Service wise: zero."
I come to pain cot on a weekly basis and often order the croque monsieur which always comes with six slices. Except today. Got 4 for the same price. Is this your new way of life pain cot? At least if the croque wasn't burned I would have felt better but no. You also had to fail that.
"Firstly the service is very slow and not that friendly. Burger came welldone. After getting a new one they suddenly put a more spicy sauce. But not worth complaining again. They just don’t seem to get it right. I do not recommend to go here, no value for money."
"In Bann Thai for the first time this week. Overall food spicy and very tasty. This place could be brilliant however is ruined by the complete lack of anything resembling customer service. Trying to order a drink was torture and finally when I left my seat to ask the waiter I met with "" I have been busy"". After a short exchange I offered to leave the restaraunt, when he replied with the a tone devoid of any customer service, "" do that I don't care"" . The manageress was not interested in doing anything even though she heard the conversation. This restaraunt is the Culinary equivalent of Ryanair. Go elsewhere, smiling courteous staff will not be found here."
"If you come here for a nice setting this place will do. If you,want to eat go elsewhere. The food was horrible. Looked like the Cook smashed it on the plate. We did enjoy the wine and settings. Staff was very nice. Maybe it was too busy and kitchen unable to cope. But i will not give it another try"
"The food was awful. Very few times have I been physically unable to consume a meal. I could not even finish 1/10 of my dish. I came here specifically because of the vegan stoofvlees, and it was inedible. My dad got a vegetarian dish that was disappointing as well. Service was terrible as well. Only redeeming quality was that the place itself was cute."
"Horrible service, food was expensive and 2 hours late while the place was half empty. Owner got angry when asked why the food was taking so long. Horrible experience would not reccomend the “restaurant” to anyone."
After 10 minutes waiting I asked for the menu and as result: Very rude waiter with lack of communication skills!
"Very unpleasant experience. A dish didn't come after more than 1h wait and multiple asks. We decided not to wait any more and complained at the payment. The manager was very rude, even showing faces and guestures. Definitely overpriced place. Not recommend at all."
"The woman who was at the bar was very rude with us, even the beer was good, the experience was bad. We tryed to talk in english and french and she did’t make any effort to understand our cuestions."
"I ordered via Deliveroo. A portion of edamame wasn’t delivered, so I called the restaurant. They told me they would send it, but nothing ever arrived. Moreover, in the Sashimi Deluxe I ordered there should have been a portion of Maguro Bhutso. Also never delivered. I think it’s unacceptable to pay for something you won’t even eat - extremely unprofessional service. I’m really disappointed and I won’t order from this place again. "
"Chose this place because of the location. The service was fine however the food was really really really bad... Had a sausage with potato but it was not good at all, the meat in the stew was hard and dry, and the ribs was just not edible. The only plus was the waiter and the location."
"Arrived at 1730 to be told the coffee machine is cleaned and closed. Guys, you advertise your times here and outside the cafe. Not good enough."
The lady that made our sandwich was very rude and poured 4 liters of mayonaise over it. We only got 1 slice of tomato?? And 2 slices egg??? Messy!!
"Food was ok and drinks were cold but the service was not so pleasant. The waiter did not offer English menu and just pointed any table for us without guiding us.I know its not a fine dinning restaurant but the attitude was bad enough for us to rate this restaurant poor ! If you dont speak local language,do not go there !"
"Too many things on the menu look like crap, smell like crap, and taste like crap. I asked for my steak medium-well, but it was frozen in the center. I found a dead cockroach on the floor of my booth. They can survive a nuclear explosion, but the entree was too much for them. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'BEWARE OF DOG (FOOD)!'"
"We went to the garden for drinks and tapas on a Wednesday evening. We had to wait 45 min before receiving our first bites, had to aks twice for our drinks who came after almost an hour and finaly, never received the other bites we ordered. Nice setting but terrible service. We will definitely not go back."
"I was there last week with my mom and daughter. We ordered 3 pastas which were awful , they should follow a cousine couse and so expensive! We paid for 3 horrible pastas a glass of wine and 2 small limoncellos 89 euros.This is inaccettabile, considering the low quality of the food. Never ever again."
"Several weeks ago I was eating at the restaurant and asking the owner if the restaurant would be open on July 29. I got the confirmation that the restaurant was open. I booked the same day on the booking system linked to the site of the restaurant. I immediately got positive confirmation. Yesterday evening I received a reminder informing me that I was expected with my guests. Today we arrived at the restaurant and it was closed. The boss of the restaurant was present, she did no effort to help me even if I was there with 6 guests. It was 100 % up to me to find a solution. Very unpleasant experience."
"Despite the great food and beautiful place, our waiter was VERY rude. Made us choose all the plates in a hurry and at the same time, barely let us read the menu. Talked to us like we were trash. Truthfully ruined our night."
The service at Korenlei Twee was extremely bad and rude. Please never-ever-ever go there when there are so many nicer and better places in Ghent! The service was abselutely bad and unfriendly. When we wanted to pay our coffee the man ripped the money out of our hande it's just a shame for Ghent because there are so many good things there. If you don't want to serve people than you should not run a restaurant! 
"Although the overall quality of the food was good, we had the feeling that the only goal of the restaurant is to get as many people in per shift and get them out as soon as possible.Service was bad and even rude. If you charge 60-100€ for a specialty-steak ( we were a group of 10 people), then you are not 'just' paying for the meat (which was very good) but also for the overall experience. I'm talking about the basics, just naming a few examples: ( (re)serving wine during diner, friendliness(""Just pick something from the menu"" as reply on a request for a drink...), just ignoring the specific remark that 3 (three!!!) filet-purs were overcooked is not done if you are a grill-restaurant. This place has some work to do..."
"We went for romantic dinner to Madonna Ghent. We made maybe a mistake without checking exactly what kind of restaurant it was (its vegan/ vegerarian only) but we wanted to give it a try once we entered, at the end the vegetarian food can be amazing :) we ordered 4 different dishes and well, saying nicely it was nothing we expected. The portions are very very small and expensive for what you get. The food is nothing special, one dish was a toast with some white sauce for 12 euros, another one ravioli (4 pieces) for similar price. (I think 14 euros or so) The funniest of this experiment was zwarte bonen pap (black beans mush) which was basically blended beans with some green leaves, I guess spinach, you suppose to eat with spoon. The service was very kind and beer very tasty (100% Belgium) but honestly the food was terrible in my opinion and I would never recommend it to anyone."
"Would give this restaurant 0 stars if this was an option.Service awful, waited half an hour for our starter.Asked for bottle of water which didn't arrive.Waited for main course, tables who arrived after us were served before us.Chased main course after nearly an hour. Was told by the manager it wouldn't be long, they hadn't told the kitchen we were ready for our mains but by this point we just wanted to leave.Manager brought over the bill, she reluctantly apologised but didn't offer to knock anything off the bill for the inconvenience.In summary, disorganised and poorly managed. Eat elsewhere."
"Food tasted very nice, but the service was very cold and distant. The waiter couldn't get away quick enough every time. We didn't feel welcome at all. Service really makes or breaks the experience. Will not visit again."
"Waited for 45 mins, meal finally came and was wrong, rude older male waiter acted like it was my fault. Food itself wasnt up to much, mc Donalds would have been beter and a 5th of the price. Fake cola and lemonade too. Never again."
We waited 1 hour to receive the chicken; half of chicken and filet of chicken. The portions were really small for the price that was asked for. Definitely not coming back and we recommend to avoid.
We received a very strange vibe from the people working there.We came to eat with a family of 5 and only received 4 menus.People where treating us very unrespecful Slechte en onvriendelijke bediening. Zeker niet aan te raden als je je eten niet wil laten bederven door negatieve energie
"Fitted us in on a busy night without a reservation which was great. Lovely venue, service was friendly but sadly the food was average/disappointing. I had the hamhock as they had sold out of pork, my first choice. The ham hock was tough, difficult to cut and tasteless. The sauce was lovely, chips good but coleslaw was just weird, more like a waldorf salad. No one asked if our food was ok until they cleared the plates when I said I hadn't really enjoyed mine. The waiter apologised but said that was the first time he had received such a complaint. Won't be returning. We thought it was expensive too."
I went to this place the first time a few months ago. I thought the food was good and the price reasonable so yesterday I decided to go there for dinner. We step in and I ask a table for two. Waiter no. 1 says something in dutch and turn his head without even answering. I still can't figure out the reason for such a rude behavior. However then comes waiter no. 2 and tells me that it's ok and let us sit. I order wine and food but right after ordering I decide to change my order so I go to him and ask if it's possible to change. Waiter no. 2 comes out of the kitchen hysterically squawking about the fact that i stepped one meter behind the bar. I decide to leave the place. Before leaving I am asked to pay 10 euros for half a liter of retsina (a kind of cheap white wine) that was untouched on the table.
"Our visit to the Brasserie Restaurant Pakhuis came on the last evening of a memorable 4-day visit to Ghent, where our visual senses and our stomachs had received more than ample sustenance. To call the evening a disappointment hardly hints at the meaning of the word.Because my wife, my daughter and I had eaten well throughout our stay, we only accepted the invitation to the Brasserie Pakhuis out of politeness to our host. Out of respect for our respective digestive systems, we eschewed the (VERY pricey) main courses and opted instead for STARTERS ALONE. I adore seafood and my eye was caught by the 'Tartaar Langoustine"" at Euros 17.50. At this price I'd expected at least one fairly decently sized langoustine. I can only describe what arrived as a triumph of culinary minimalism. One small langoustine, about the size of a prawn, had been dissected into four small pieces, each wrapped in a small piece of beef. A nondescript sauce had been drizzled over this and the whole was completed with two tiny strips of cucumber and a piece of radish. And all for the princely sum of Euros 17.50! Had it not been for the kindness of my wife and daughter sharing their smoked salmon with me, a dramatic case of 'night starvation' would have set in later that evening.The other problem with this establishment was that the waiting staff never smiled - the only time this happened during our stay. In this respect the staff, who were otherwise efficient, appeared to take their cue from the heavily-pregnant mâitresse d'. When I went to pay my bill - Euros 58.40 for 3 starters, 3 small beers and 1 50cl bottle of water - I asked this lady if a gratuity had already been added. She hedged the answer, but my wife said the mâitresse d' appeared to imply a tip had already been added, ""but many of our customers like to add a little more."" I fought an impulse to retort to this, but we shall avoid the Brasserie Pakhuis on future visits to this magnificent medieval city."
"This place was really busy. We were given a table by the toilets. It was covered with leftovers from its previous occupants but no-one came back to clean the table. We should probably have left at this point but we persevered, cleaned the table with wet wipes and tissues and waited for service. The wait between each step of service was really long as is our list of complaints:The large beers were marked as being 500ml but were served 33cl glasses.The lasagne was mostly cheese sauce.Whole pink peppercorns don't belong in any dish.A globule of lasagne sauce was flicked over one of us but the waiter didn't care/notice.Soup was served without bread, as with everything else we had to wait ages to get anyones attention (landed up waving across the room) to fix this.Could see into the loos a bit too much.Unpleasant atmosphere. None of us would go back, and when other friends tried to steer us that way the next day (claiming to have seen some nice places by the river) we were all vocal in general displeasure for the place."
"I have never written reviews in TripAdvisor. The experience in Alice (twice during the same month) was so bad that this has prompted me to save some pain for other people out there. Everyone is aware that breakfasts start late on Saturdays..We were there at 10 AM (that is when they open the doors) and the moment we started eating something was at 11.15 AM!! (I mean, I had to literally beg twice, ""could you please look into our order"") Either they learn to hire good people or they need to send out their waitresses for ""hospitality training"". We ordered scrambled eggs without the bacon and we got one with bacon after one hour of waiting. Won't you be furious? And you ask something like ""Grote breakfast"" and they don't even give you everything you ask for. You have to counter check yourself and remind their ""ultra busy"" waitresses, ""Ah, it seems you have forgotten something in our breakfast""...Ridiculous, really!Please stay away from this costly nightmare, you are better off with a couple of croissants from the Panos!"
"This is a soup bar. The soup was not very good, service is not friendly and the apple I got for dessert was bad... a very bad experience."
"Firstly you should be aware that there are two restaurants here:1 The beefeater restaurant is at the back where large steaks are cut and cooked by your waiter to your order on a stove in a corner archway - which looked OK2 The brasserie at the front where you are crammed into tables and largely ignored by the single waiter trying to cope with over 20 tables.Unfortunately we ate in the brasserie and it was an ordeal.- 3 hours to get through the set menu. With only 2 choices and the same every day they should be able to churn that out- over 1 hour before we got anything at all to eat (not even bread)- drinks repeatedly forgotten- worst of all the waiter simply blanked us - even when all 4 of us were waving arms to be served - and we were sitting in the middle not tucked into a corner- not a single word of apology for the delay, even when the boss took my money and I told him it was not acceptable. Is saying sorry really so difficult?When the food came it was fine, though run of the mill rather than anything special.The old fashioned medieval style (plus frog mannequins) décor is the main strong point - idiosyncratic I think you'd sayLord only knows how this place is rated #44/600+ in Ghent - it should be nearer #590..."
"T'was almost 15 yrs since i last visited the place. T'will for sure be 15 yrs till next time, and then only if hit by premature amnesia.We wanted mussels, and on a monday, not many restaurants open, hence... such a pity. minuscule mussels, blandly cooked and dumped on a too small table .Service poor to absent. The only time someone tried to recognise we were there with a smile, was when i went to settle the bill.It is a pity that restaurants were the owners have zero interest in how the foor reaches the plate, and only in the € they can take out of the business daily, are able to survive. Only thanks to the low-sill allowing them to trick people who are afraid to go to a better place, where they'd pay the same, but get good stuff instead.Shame. Waste of our money. Lesson learned."
Frozen and tasteless food . I thought I will have quality du to the high price like 28eur for a waterzooi. Tourist trap . Forget about it . Even the French fries are similar to Mac Donald .
"The place is not worth a visit.We were 7 friends who decided eat here. Waited for like 40-45min (the restaurant was almst empty).Some of our friends ordered meat medium well done, but they had a well done meat instead.The pasta was overcooked and the average taste was bad.You can find better places in Ghent."
"I visited Ghent for the first time with my family (husband and two children - 2 and 5 years old). My youngest child finally slept and we decided to choose a restaurant to eat before continuing our tour. Well, things didn't happen as we imagined. We ask for three drinks and we had to wait a lot for it. My husband asked for the drinks again, and the waiter finally brougth it. So, we chose our food (nothing sophisticathed, just the daily menu - a salad with steak tartare), after one and a half hour, we realized that the tables around us (that arrived AFTER us) had already had their food. So, we immediately decided to ask for the bill, The bill came with all food that we didn't eat!!! So, after a complaint to the same waiter ( I just told him that I had never had an experience like that and the restaurant was a deception). I gave him 50 euros and asked him for my change. He answer: - yes if you f... shut up! We were deeper scared with his attitude. A place that don't respect a family, a mother with two children, a client (tourists). Worst experience ever!"
"Really disapointed despite the very nice place.Ordered apple juice --> Got orange juice / Ordered two pastas with cream --> Got spagetthi bolognese / We asked politely to be hidden a little bit from the sun --> Answer ""NO"" without any alternative proposal / Tuna in the salade Nicoise was not even cooked / Asked to split the Bill in two --> Answer ""NO"" / Time to get served (2 pastas, 1 sandwich, 1 salad, 4 soft drinks) --> more than 1h / ==> Total bill 70€, what a joke to pay so expensive to be treated like...nothing that I can write here. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!"
"This restaurant has a fantastic location, but that is all that we found good about it. We found this place by Googling Gent Restaurants for Lobster hoping for a nice lobster dinner. They headline lobster as a specialty which is very misleading. There was only one option for oven baked lobster included in a set price meal which we didn't want. We ended up with the Lobster Bellvue which is a cold lobster dish. When we mentioned our dissatisfaction that we were not told in advance this dish was served cold, the response was that ""everyone knows Bellvue is a cold dish"". I regularly dine in Lobster restaurants worldwide and myself didn't know this, so considering the amount of tourists and foreigners that are visiting this place, they should have a more cosmopolitan and transparent approach and explain this up front on the menu, All of the food, while creative and of average quality, appears to be pre-made and kept in the refrigerator for then delivery to the table, so it wasn't really that fresh. The quality/price ratio was awful and the wait staff are rude.I will never go back."
"We were looking forward to have dinner here, great view, great location and we heard a couple of mixed reviews about this place. Unfortunately turned out to be a complete disaster!The restaurant was not busy and only the tables outside on the terrace were taken (and this was a Friday evening in August). Table service was very helpful and polite. We ordered for 5 people, there was some issue with the handhelds but the orders were also written down so everything was going to be ok. Oh boy, were they wrong. First, after about an hour of waiting, the fish and two steaks arrived. The other two dishes, lobster and herring dish, were missing. Although the steaks were ordered rare they arrived on the table overcooked. We addressed this and immediately the steaks were taken back with an additional apology for the missing two main dishes. The waitress also informed us that the 4 main dishes would come back to the table together. Another half hour later the steaks came back but still without the lobster and herring dish. The waitress, visible distressed did everything she did to cover for the malfunctioning of the kitchen. 2.5 hours later we finished our main dish in 3 different sessions. The complimentary coffee was a nice gesture of the waitress but too little too late.A restaurant like this should be a gold mine, unfortunately I don't have high expectations for their future unless they can address their huge logistic issues."
many times my orders have been horrible!!times i get semi-cold too long layout out food (before the revamp of the restaurant)before and even AFTER their revamp and all that i have had multiple times some of the hamburgers i order for the take-away are not even there!! sometimes i'd get a cheaper hamburger i did not order but like when i ordered a limited edition hamburger with a big mac.. only hamburger i had gotten was the bigmac.. not even a cheaper hamburger to spot.. the limited edition was paid for but not received!!!
"Ordered the Entrecôte but it was not edible due to much fat.
Complained ofcourse but did not get offered another one and it was on our bill nevertheless.
Also extremely small tables very close to other guests.
Tourist trap. Avoid!"
"Our first visit to this establishment in Ghent. We have already visited other PQ, but this one was extremely slow and unpleasant. Took 5' until someone asked us for a place to sit and another 10' to order and for them to clean up the table. The waitress even thought that we were asking for the check. 30' to order 2 chocolate milk and a croissant. Took another 20' for them to bring and... no croissant. We asked the waitress and she went checking for it, which took another 20' without any explanation. I can understand that it is busy, but there is no communication whatsoever. A bit of more personal communication would be much appreciated."
"We made a reservation for the shift of 5:30 pm. When we arrived on time, the door was open. We entered the restaurant and were promptly asked to leave the restaurant without any reason.After waiting 10' on the street, the owner came outside. He didn't invite us to come in, but to move, so he was able to put the menu card on the place where we stood. We finally decided to go inside again and were helped by a friendly girl, who gave us a table.We chose 8 tapas. The tapas with the salmon smelled not fresh and didn't taste well either.We wouldn't anyone advise to go there eating tapas."
"Don’t get fooled by the polished Belgian appearance. Restaurant is over priced with very average food, Not worth your time and money. It is easier to make a reservations since the neighborhood higher rated restaurants are harder to get a reservation at. If you are planning your trip, suggest you book the FouD’O (two weeks in advance!), same price but more easy going, kind, inclusive and flexible service."
It was our favourite restaurant in Ghent until today. Today in the toilets I saw a cook not washing the hands after the defecation. You are warned!
"I visited with a group of friends. The location itself was ok for a night out with friends. First we were told that because we were so many (we were 9) we can only order 4 different dishes in total. TBH I’ve never seen that anywhere… I ordered the special, which was fish burger on a bagel with small potatoes on the side. The food arrived, and it was covered in coriander leaves (which I cannot eat). I took them off, cut into the burger only to find even more coriander inside! No coriander was mentioned on the menu… I complained and was offered a vegetarian burger as a replacement for the same price. As I didn’t want to be difficult I agreed. Big mistake! What arrived then was a cold, tasteless piece of veggie burger, clearly made of frozen vegetables, and with absolutely no flavour at all. I didn’t even eat half of it. The bagel was dry and not fresh, and the potatoes were cold. All this for 20 Eur! All in all a very disappointing culinary experience… will definitely never go there again. BTW, the food my friends had was also quite disappointing. The vegan dish was not vegan, and everything else rather tasteless and not good quality/value for money. Not to be recommended for food!"
"The setting is lovely, especially to people watch. Be careful that you do not sit at the wrong seat. There appear to be three bars/restaurants, but its not clear which is which as the tables and chairs all blend into one.We accidently sat in the wrong place and had to then suffer the wrath of a rude waitress who took pleasure in being sarcastic. We stayed because there wasn't anywhere else and we had travelled for a while. However, one beer and we left. Beer was very good, shame about the staff."
"Never ever anywhere have we been treated in such an arrogant ,unfriendly way as in this so called pub. Because many local drunks and hooligans visit this place they think they can get away with everything. Like all Irish pubs outside Eire this is a completely fake pub but that you know when you go into such a place. What you don't know is that the service it pure Fawlty Towers in an unfuny way, the food is greasy and stale, that the drinks are served extremely unprofessionally and that the staff is arrogantly rude. On top of that ever the food and drink are much too expensive. The owner apparently (so we were told by a member of staff) was more drunk than most of the patrons (and most of them were clearly inebriated)So please avoid this place and go to the many really friendly, nice places that Ghent is rich (in the same neighbourhood: De Loge, De Jan van Gent, Het Zwarte Gat and even the folkloric Midi & Centerken)"
"Went to this place after seeing it recommended in Lonely Planet and rated high on trip advisor. Felt like we had the cloak of invisibility when we walked in. Finally got attention of staff and were seated then neglected for 10 minutes. I then asked for menu ...slow .. ordered drinks ... slow ...ordered food ... slow. You get the idea. When food finally arrived 50 minutes after ordering, it was good and creative but by then we just wanted to go home. Tip for the owners ... you food is good but your staff need to be more attentive to your customers."
Waited for over an hour for a main meal from the specials board and beef stew. The manager was there when we told the waitress we were leaving made no attempt to approach us.Table service first class - very good standard of English. Let down by poor kitchen service and management. There are lots of very good restaurants in Ghent we only went into this one to get out of the rain. It was a huge mistake. My advise is don't go there.
"We went to this restaurant because it was the only one with a table available. Big mistake!! Terrible service, were getting eyeballed and 'tsst' by the waiter because we could'nt understand his mumbling. After waiting more than an hour for our food we asked how long it was going to be before it was ready. They forgot... Had to re-order and wait some more. You'd think that when you're almost starving any food would be satifactory. But when it eventually was served it turned out to be a nightmare. Asked for the bill and left for the McD, heavenly food there compared to this 'restaurant'. "
Staff oblivious. Waited an age for service on a Sunday evening and eventually decided to leave. Glasses left on table but not excessively busy.
"When you book a restaurant with a help of a five star hotel concierge, you expect, as minimum, good service and quality food. But reality is always beyond any expectation.Despite our timely arrival, we had to wait for our table another 40 minutes. The explanation was that all the tables booked, but our table had not yet released by other guests. No drinks were offered as a compliment. After a long time, making an order, we tried to find out the details of cooking the dish of the day in order to decide whether order it or not. As a result, we got a dish that we would never order if we were told how it would be.in the attempt to understanding with the staff, we received rudeness in response that we are tourists who do not understand anything, refused to remove the dish from the boll and completely ignored us from that time."
"I have ordered via Uber eat a pizza margherita deluxe ( 18 Euro ) with delivery charge!!The pizza was a simple margherita with burrata and rucola...do you call this burrata??!! That was something really far from being a burrata!! You are ripping off clients, but you cannot give to someone that knows what is burrata that mozzarella stuff on top of the pizza...and this has nothing to do with Uber eat!This is not burrata, this is not burrata, this is not burrata, this is not burrata...eat and repeat, this is not burrata...."
"I live close to this place and have been there on several occasions after hearing good comments from others. I'm not going there again however. The pizzas are nothing special - not bad but not memorable either. The service and friendliness of the owner is disastrous. You are urged to make reservations by phone for take-away or for eating in which is perfectly OK of course. But once you get there, she's either forgotten about your order/reservation or just informs you in the most brutal way imaginable that you'll have to wait for about an hour. Or wait, make it 1 1/2 hours. Seriously. This happened 4-5 times in a row, and frankly, the pizzas are definately not worth it."
"The service was very slow and very unfriendly. A lot went wrong, i’ll save you an extensive list. Conclusion: I would advise to stay away from this place."
"the nice atmosphere is gone, no organic products anymore, no friendly service, dirty toilets, not enough food, waiting a very long time, and we paid way too much! I really don't recommend it to anyone, waste of time and money :("
Dirty place with arrogant service and very expensive.
"Waited over 40 minutes for a starter of smoked salmon with toast, eventually gave up paid for our 2 flat cokes and left.As we were leaving they appeared with plates of the worst looking food I have ever seen, totally white 'toast' and substandard salmon off cuts. They were just not interested in providing either a decent service or decent food. "
"Such a shame this kind of bad food experience happened in the lovely city that Ghent is... Brasserie De Jacob has a bad service, worse food and the worst wine ever. To start with the wine, it tasted like acid. When asked where this wine was from, they could not answer even though the chef was a wine conoisseur, how strange... The underlying message was that we had to be quiet and just drink it.Every dish we had, was covered in a greasy creamy white sauce where the scampis, meat or (canned) vegetables were floating in. Yuk. Why would you do that?The service and atmosphere were unfriendly and unprofessional as we had to pay a lot more for our filthy wine than expected.Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else, Ghent has to offer so much more."
"The food is good but the service is very rude! You have to wait outside a long que to get a table and the owner checks and correct the line up not to block the road but the way it is done is just very unpolite. If you have a cup of coffee while you are waiting in the cold que from somewhere else, you are not allowed to get inside and you are again corrected rudely, after waiting 30-60min outside you get inside but waiters/owner can still ask you “how did you get inside” ? Above all, you can get comments that “you are lucky to be accepted because you are group of 6 plus a baby so seven and next time it will not be accepted”) ( be careful: there is rule of maximum six person including kids and babies)I understand the restaurant have some rules but the way that they operate around these rules is simply rude. It can be a good breakfast but having welcoming humble service is something that this restaurant need to learn. I strongly advise to go somewhere else in Gent so your beautiful sunday morning with your friends does not ruin by a restaurant who treats you very rude."
"Waited 45 minutes for a coffee and noticed everyone around complaining about the service. When complaining was bitten nose off by shamelesly rude staff. Finally received coffee and biscuit was shared (broken in half) with neighbouring customer. Cancelled the rest of the order and waited another 20 minutes to receive the bill, which was incorrect while only 3 items were ordered. Bad day or just bad place? Will not come back here again"
"Let me just set the tone of this review. It was my mothers 70th birthday, my wife is pregnant for 3rd child and i travelled all the way back to my home country to celebrate my mothers birthday! So everyone in good mood and happiness all around! my 5y old daughter was dressing up and looking forward to see oma.This became a ice cold shower as a welcome.. not hello welcome... immediately tone from owner:” this is a restaurant!”., huh? I have travelled around world dined in countless michelin star restaurants... only thinking i misheard... then still in mood: “can we order bottle champagne with 6 glasses” was countered with.., pff its normally 5, i will need to pour out in bar now? Again what, huh?This theme continues throughout, clearly the family or children was a problem although we asked upfront about Birthday and children were behaved and dressed better than other guests (euh only 4). The problem is clearly that owner is in mental crisis of having no clientele.. everything was our problem... bottles not on wine list the shambles continues and all our problem. Your restaurant is empty for a reason!The worst is that we asked if they could do something for my mothers birthday, my daughter was looking forward to do something for oma, she drew picture 2 weeks ago, straight : no! “Not standard and prepared” they said , “we dont have lots chefs and big kitchen!!!?” What? To put a candle on s desert? Even a pizza place does it... btw they never said happy birthday to my mother.. so im still upset... but anyway i ll say it hereGelukkige verjaardag Mama!Avoid restaurant at all cost!!!Anyone think to book please call me if you like to know real experience, happy to explain everything.+44 7979 018 019"
"We arrived at this restaurant yesterday, YES I fully appreciate the town fair was on so everywhere was busy however. My husband and I entered the restaurant only about 5 tables occupied so we found a table sat down a waitress quickly came over and said hello I’m sorry I can’t serve you I am assigned to the tables outside this evening. We said ok she then said a waitress should be with you shortly, a good 15 minutes went passed with lots of staff passing our table each time we tried to get their attention but sadly we seemed invisible. After another 10 minutes a family walked in sat themselves down around the other side of the restaurant and were served immediately. At this point 30 minutes after entering the restaurant we got up and left. Bearing in mind it was 30 degrees outside a nice cold drink would have been nice while we looked at the menu, didn’t even see a menu. Wouldn’t recommend this place at all. I have my own pub so I fully appreciate how busy it can get at times however 30 minutes and still no sign of getting served a drink let alone a menu in my book is ridiculous."
"Only go here if you wish to self harm or you loathe your dining partner.The bread was wet. As in dropped in the sink wet.The beer was some kind of beer cocktail mixed with Creme de Menthe. Someone had punched a massive hole in the wall of the mens bathroom and the wall paper around it had started to mold.The soap in the bathroom you had to pour on your hands from a bottle that looks like they had found on the street.The red wine was served in pre-opened 1.5 liter bottles they had on the table and you drank as much as you wanted then they measured what was left in the bottle and charged you accordingly. I would imagine they then returned the dregs of your bottle to the reservoir of semi-putrid red wine they kept in the basement for refilling.The ribs were from an animal - as yet unidentified - likely cat, which seemed to have some form of double rib layout which meant that it was mostly bone; there is more flesh on a normal sized eyelid. Also the ribs had a membrane on them. Cat rib membrane. The toilet and several other places around the restaurant were decked out in framed cross-stitch praising Christ.On the plus side it seems that it's all the ribs you can eat which explains why we never saw any cats wandering around the town."
"Asked for a glass of water (having spent €85 each on food and drink) and you'd swear I'd asked for a discount on the meal. Asked a few waitresses and waiters fot a simple glass of water as we are on our second bottle of wine, having already had 3 courses each. They seemed to have a culture of asking why we wanted it and that the chef was too busy (what the chef has to do with the taps I don't know). Atmosphere changed when we asked for the water and waiters started ignoring us. We're sitting here now with a full bottle of wine (not wanting to drink it without some warer) and we just want to leave because they staff have made it so awkward for us. BEWARE OF ASKING FOR A MEASLY GLASS OF WATER!!!"
"Yesterday came here and ordered three coffees. The friendly lady behind the bar took our order promising to bring the coffee to the table THEN WENT AWAY somewhere to do whatever else; the place was almost entirely empty and it was clear that she just didn’t care. After sitting for 15 minutes or so, we went to complain only to be met with genuine incredulity as to what was the big deal. What confused me most is that the lady kept insisting that all that time she was absent “she was making it” (the coffee), while the coffee machine stood unattended and she was away. The attitude is scandalous, and the coffee is average; unless you want to sit in a empty cafetaria soaking in a smell of fried oil, waiting for an espresso for 15 minutes, get your coffee someplace else. "
"I'll split my review to three categories: venue, food and service and explain in-depth why I cannot recommend Roots. We visited Roots in February, 2020 with a group of four. Reservation and arriving to restaurant was flawless. Venue is cute, and decorated in a tasteful manner. So far so good.We decided to enjoy a full menu, accompanied with recommended wines. Two of us were vegetarians (myself included). One dish was uncooked and we send it back to kitchen. Ok, these things happen. Then we hear the chef calling us idiots, and cursing that we don't understand the food philosophy. This happened in open kitchen, in front of all kitchen stuff and other guests. I felt embarrassed and humiliated. Rest of the vegetarian dishes were poor or moderate, quality-wise. Due to the service and unmet expectations, we decided to cut our dinner short and leave.The icing on the cake was, when the owner tried to charge us with the whole amount, despite that we didn't eat all courses on the menu. When we declined to pay for food we didn't eat, she threatened to call the police. Just to clarify a few things: yes, I know what Michelin-mentioned (& star) restaurants can be expected. Yes, I have also visited in modern and innovative places. No, I wouldn't go here, especially if you're vegan, vegetarian or don't want to experience disrespectful service."
"We visited here for a birthday meal after reading recommendations online. Nice interior but this is where the good experience stops. I ordered the 'Asian & Spicy' mussels which had zero flavour, certainly no spice and the sauce (which was described in the menu as a coconut curry) tasted more like watery cabbage soup... and to top it off, they still had some sand in them. My partner ordered the Limousin steak which came with a quarter chunk of an ice-berg lettuce drizzled with some bland sauce and a potato salad which was dry, flavourless and lacked seasoning. The steak itself was not the worst, but lacked the juice usually associated with this good cut of meat. The entire meal was bland, flavourless and poorly seasoned and definitely not worth the money. When the waiter finally came round to take our (half eaten) plates away and asked us we had enjoyed the food, we told him it was all a little bit disappointing. He informed the manager who came to speak to us who told us it was a shame we did not tell them earlier, but this would have been impossible seeing as we never even got asked for another drink let alone how our meal was- the waiters were too busy serving the business trip tables."
"We never got to the food I'm afraid After waiting 65 mins for our appetisers to arrive we walked out This was after a series of polite enquiries to various waiting staff Waitresses were out of their depths, out of control and the individual who was taking the orders was not worthy of serving in backstreet chippieDisplaying levels of rudeness and ignorance I have not before witnessed in a decent restaurants, she (Sybil) headed a staff who were not told what customers were having what food and in what order and were basically handing out food and beverage to whoever screamed the loudestAfter finally giving up I confronted Basil the hapless manager who asked me what exactly we were waiting for !! Eerr - Food!! At least Fawlty Towers was hilariously funny!Avoid "
"Don't be fooled by the Trip Advisor sticker in the window. We saw this and thought this venue would be ok.
The service was slow to non-existent, the food took ages to arrive and was ok, average for the price. I wouldn't go back."
"Although the kitchen was supposed to be open thirty more minutes they turned us down at the door. Unreasonable, but maybe we’re the lucky ones looking at the other reviews..."
They don't take credit cards! They forgot my order. Pancake is decent though. WC pissed around. No waffles.
"As a regular visitor to Thailand you allways need some Thailand in Belgium,so let us try a new place,lunch is a great idea to have an impression at a low cost about 15€ for the friday buffet why not;So first of all only one couple when we arrived around 12;15,interior of restaurant sos so,seating stainde,but ok no problem in Thailand we eat in other places than that and food is allways superb,we ordered drinks,ok it came rapidly and then The Buffet,it was really terrible,a clear vegetable soup that I tried at my own risk,some plates with dry chicken and some vegetables that was it ,it tasted like a bad chines and not Thai at all;the wors part is that my wife posted a review on facebook and she was insulted in a way much worse tha the food we had"
Wonderful position but unfriendly staff. Low quality products that are not worth their prices. Definitely a no.
"Very poor service . I donot mind the staff talking amongst themselves ... but seated with their backside on one of the tables . VERY POOR indeed. By The Way what all these onion rings were doing on evry single pizza , is still a mystery to me ! Very poor ... AVOID !!"
Bad service. After 10 minutes we left because they were not interested in serving us. Not the place to be!!!!
"The restaurant looks nice, nice pictures on the walls, menu looks nice but then it all went downhill... hostess / waitress could not have been more unwelcoming. Not one smile, it felt like we were disturbing her but then we realized it was a trend for all waitresses. The starters has tomato soup and tomato mozzarella, not very Asian for a wok restaurant... main course was ordinary, the chef could also use some positivity. We did not try the desserts as they all looked like defrosted items i can buy in the supermarket. We were not thirsty so we did not order anything to drink; when asked we said we would order after the food. Another waitress came to see us and asked again if we wanted to order drinks. We were then told we had to order drinks! I even double checked and asked if they would force us to drink something?!In short, service is horrible, food is not good and be sure to be thirsty when you visit!"
"Great to drink a coffee during the day.  Don't eat here during the evening. Really a pity, it could be a beautiful place with some small adjustment (music, lightning,  better quality of meat for a cook that makes delicious sauce ...)"
"I lived 5 years in Italy and I recognize Italian food in this restaurant you don't really eat Italian, everything seems frozen, the pizza not the greatest salty and burnt hard to cut and eat"
"We came to this dreadful restaurant as a large group. It is awful with nothing to recommend it. Bad service, bad food and generally bad atmosphere. I frankly cannot understand why anyone would choose to help there. Please avoid at all costs!"
"This was the worst food I've encountered in a very long time. A plate of various unidentifiable (apart from the baked beans!) slimy concoctions topped with a lamb kebab which was so overcooked and tough it was inedible!The service was virtually non-existent, too - we were left to our own devices with literally nobody on hand for a good 15 minutes before we could settle up and leave.The overall impression was that the people running the place, cooking the food and providing the service just couldn't care less!"
"This is NOT the place for ribs. The service is terrible. The sauce and seasoning is acrid and not well thought out. If you get there early your first rack will be ok, but later on they get overwhelmed, but they will risk serving you an undercooked or burnt rack. There are too many cheap sides they want you to fill up on, so they can save money on the ribs they don't give you.I've been 3times, once to try, the second to confirm and the third because of a pushy friend who didn't know better."
"Rude, dismissive and unfriendly staff! 
Disproportionately expensive food: 2 fried eggs - 10 euro!?
I do not recommend to anyone!"
"My family and I went Sunday Sept. 12th,2021 to have a goodbye lunch before we head back to US. We ordered drinks then we all placed our ordered. After about 1/2 hr we received our food, two persons ordered the duck - one received several pieces and the other person seem to have received the left overs - when they started to eat, the duck was so tuff it was impossible to cut with a butter knife let alone a steak knife, the waitress took my uncles dish back, which he replaced with a different dish, but my cousin wasn’t allowed to return her dish for something else, then my husband and I received our dish the Beef Carpaccio, my husbands dish was ok, but the one I received looked like someone else’s reject and it had no flavor tuff it was not edible complained to the waitress and abruptly told me others were satisfied so no I could not replace she was adamant and quickly left, my other uncle had Cod he said it was ok not great.I found the food to be of poor quality, tasteless, I’m not a great cook but compared to what I received here at this restaurant I would say I’m a great cook.When I go to a restaurant I expect quality food if it isn’t edible I expect that they rectify the problem not push a customer aside and force to pay for poor quality food. We went out to this restaurant to enjoy our family and eat good food, we didn’t receive quality meals. We paid the bill, but I will never return to this restaurant, I gave it a 1 star and this is being polite for the 1 star is one too many"
"During our visit to Ghen we enjoyed very much walking around the old town, the shops and the wonderful buildings. we stopped for Tea and waffle at this Restaurant. we were 4 adults and two children. we ordered four cups of tea, Apple cake and a waffle. after a couple of minutes we asked for a spare fork.... when we got the check we saw that they CHARGED US 2.5 Euro FOR THE FORK!!!! outrageous and unbelievable.... Never experienced such a thing.. will never Return.. "
"Friendly service, but way too expensive for the quality of food that evening.The experience we hoped to get did not happen. Food was a disappointment apart from the small dishes accompanying the champagne.I can only hope that the chef had a bad moment seen all the nice reviews. Will we be returning? I doubt it."
"Such a bad experience,we were treated like a bunch of dummies by an arrogant bald waiter with a personality problem, when the food (meze) arrived we found burned dried out scampies with elastic calamares and microwave heated meat on our dish, the only good thing on the plate was the salad and feta cheese and the taramasala which you can easily buy in a shop or the marketplace, he (the bald waiter) asked what was wrong, upon telling him what the problem was he shrugged it off and disappeared like greased lightning....bye forever..."
"Two guys who take over one of the most famous catering businesses in Aalst. Too bad they can't maintain the same level. Judging by their clothing, you don't even notice that the waiter is indeed the waiter or even the manager. Additionally, the blond waiter is rude and even a bit hypocritical towards the customers. Tables where acquaintances are seated receive preferential treatment.The food is okay, but pricey. There are way too many drinks on the menu, it takes forever to get a cocktail. I regret that they harm the Savarin's name. I'm not coming back here."
"Unpleasant service. Illogical additional payment.. I don't recommend !!!
at the checkout I have to pay extra for the fact that I was in the restaurant with an accompanying person.."
"Sat down inside to have dinner at 9:15. Ordered a bottle of House Cava, ordered food and 15 minutes after they tell me I can only eat one plate, kitchen is closing. Asked why they sat me down if they could not serve dinner. Answer:Sorry kitchen can’t take care of you for two dishes. Note: my order was sparragus and Lobster salad, not very complicated!!!! Totally hated to finish a marvelous day in Ghent with this. At least I was allowed to finish my cava in the terrace with the waiters picking up all the chairs!!!"
"One profits from the earlier good reputation.
Although the service is friendly and professional, the quality of the food is extremely poor.
No fresh products, but deepfried and pre-prepared.
Also expensive."
"The waiters are very ruge, always pushing you to eat and drink fast, for sure the worst service I have had in Belgium. Besides the river view and nice environment in the summer, I really do not recommend this restaurant. The food in over priced (but it was not a surprise because the location), with very low quality and small portions."
"I loved Grand cafe Godot and used to go there every week. But apparantly, good customers are not remembered these days, they prefer a large turnover. Unfortunately, it's at the expense of the service they provide. They won't see me (or my friends) again.This is what happened. Yesterday, the first day of sun in Ghent, I wanted to have my regular pasta on the terrace. I was asked (quite rudely) to move inside because outside was only 'restaurant'. Astonished, I repeated that we were going to have pasta (with cocktails on the side, as usual). The maitre (not the chief, he is a cool guy) insisted (again firmly) pasta was considered a 'snack' at the Godot and we had to move. This offended me, who can argue pasta is not a meal?! Who wants to know what their guests are eating before you can sit outside? This offended me quite a bit so we decided to (gracefully) excuse ourselves to find a great table at the terrace of the restaurent 'du progres' on the Korenmarkt. I had pasta and my friends steak (James Bond), it was great -> check out my review of the place.And don't go to the Godot for good service..."
"Highly suggest you find another place to eat. This establishment treats customers in the worst manner. You call for a reservation to eat on the terrace but terrace is closed. When we ask how come with such a beautiful weather, the waiter answers: oh f* off, and hangs up on our face? I’ve never witnessed that not even at a fast food restaurant. Run away!"
-french fries were not fresh. It seems that they were baked a couple of times. The price for the fries was 7 euro per person... this is unacceptable for some fries that weren't even fresh  - menu was not up to date. Which made us spend more that we had foreseen.  -I had a beyond burger the burger was good but not great.
"My boyfriend and I had dinner in this restaurant tonight and it was awful! (Name is now: Vaudeville. As a starter we had the carpaccio, it was not fresh at all and it probably just came out of the freezer as it was all wet.. My boyfriend did not finish his course (just took one bite) and still had to pay the whole course! As a main course I had the lasagne which was okay, but not special. My advice is to NOT go here if you want to have a nice experience "
"Like so many other reviews, this place is just not want it was. Made to wait for everything - from being seated, getting menus, ordering, food arriving (eventually the right food). The service was awful. Comments from the waiters 'well, you didn't ask me for the wine' (when asked why it was late; 'what do you expect - these are frites (never had such large, soggy ones in my life); 'what do you want?'. One member of staff was aggressive and general attitude was 'really don't care'. Sent back 1 main course and frites. Was told that the problems were that they were busy. Not that they were disorganised, chaotic and had staff who did not want to be there. The manager offered to take off the price of the frites. I had to ask for my main course - uneaten (and complained about at the time), to be also removed. It used to be so good. Really bad start to a lovely romantic birthday weekend away."
"Burgers are average but service is terrible even by gent standards. First they told us it was not possible to get a burger with only meat and tomato....OK. then after asking twice for a burger with no ketchup they bring me one with ketchup...their response ""not my fault the ticket said no ketchup...mistake in the kichten"" so they bring me a new bun 10min later when my burger is already cold. Avoid this place there are much better burger places walking distance! "
"I and my friends planned to have dinner in this unfriendly restaurant, My friend's wife who is an African got there first while others was busy looking for parking. She stood there more than 5mins unattended even when she tried speaking to the old man waiter, he looked at her with total disgust. A lady managed to speak to her and she gave our reservation number yet she was told to stand at the hall way instead of ushering her to our table. But when we came, all the waiters were on their feet trying to attend to us: PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN. If you are an African or ur partner is an African, this is not an ideal place for you. WE SAY NO TO RACISM!!!"
"We spent an evening at this restaurant. We arrived at 8. Our main course was served at 10.40! Even though the food was certainly good, the restaurant cannot deliver the type of service that you expect from a restaurant with prices that suggest it is a high end restaurant. Too bad."
"A convenient spot on one of the shopping streets, and the nice terrace are the only two positives here. The tables were cleared but not cleaned when customers left, the apple on the salad was cooked with cinnamon (probably to be served with an apple pie) and gave the otherwise not seasoned chicken that same dessert like taste. Staff seemed uninterested. Not to be repeated. "
"Tonight we decided to go back to the Klokkeput, a restaurant we used to like a lot. The scampi diabolique was my dad's favorite dish. Tonight we were really disappointed with the service and the food. We ordered champaign and the waiter told us whilst putting our glasses on the table that the barman had been really generous. Indeed, the glasses were completely filled but hey, that wasn't our fault. As a starter my mother ordered oysters and had 1 (out of 6) that wasn't fresh and tasted really bad. As a main dish, we ordered ""sole ostendaise"" and a linguine with lobster. Never seen so much tomatoes on a pasta with tomato sauce as on our sole ostendaise. The sauce tasted really bad and there were way too much tomatoes on our plate. My daughter had 3 small pieces of lobster in her pasta. When I mentioned this, the waiter told us that it was half a lobster in there..... In short, this was a really bad experience and an expensive one as well. We like to eat and aren't afraid of paying for good food but this really felt as a rip off!!! We will never go back again. This used to be a restaurant where reservations were required otherwise no place. Tonight, half of the restaurant was empty. If they don't change chef and the waiters' attitude, it will be completely empty very soon."
Two weeks in Belgium and this was the most expensive restaurant. We both ordered the lobster. It was overcooked and rubbery. Owners were cranky. Husband in great need of a bath and deodorant. Wife crabby…maybe because of husband’s odor.Many other really good places to go!
"We struggled finding our way in but that lead to an interesting and circular walk. The experience inside was underwhelming. The carpaccio was still frozen, the beef stew was wildly chewy (wore out my cheeks :)) and the wine heavily sedimented. Shame."
I can summarize my visit in one word: Horrible. The beef was so undercooked it started eating the salad. My water glass was stained with lipstick and had bits of food floating in it. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE!'
We ordered mussels and fish casserole. It was not fresh and a smell was strange. I complained to a waiter and asked chef to come. The chef was so busy with half empty restaurant that refused to come. I asked to call him 3 times and he refused to come 3 time.Absolutely bad service.Never eat here!
"I'm Italian and I an ensure you that this is a really bad pizza! Even a frozen pizza is better than what we ate here. I girl at my table got what was supposed to be a carbonara... Just wrong ingredients, terrible appearance and horrible smell! Stay away from this place if you want real Italian food!"
Very expensive really very disspointed will never go again.6 scampis with 18 euro very bad breads. Doesnt seem to belong to turkish restaurents.
"If you like over cooked pasta go there.
Not really italian.. ifnyou make wrong pasta, and it is your main dish, something wrong."
"'T Paradijs is an unassuming restaurant directly across from the Gravensteen Castle and near the town's information center. The local beer is Augustijn Grand Cru and only to be found in the Ghent area. The menu is largely seafood as the town's many canals flow to the sea and bring in fresh sea-food. I chose pesto pasta that was filled with cloves of garlic and vegetables. There was no mistaking that all the ingredients were fresh, including the multi-grain bread. There is also a sizeable selection of steaks and finger-foods. This was one of the more pleasant dining discoveries during my time in Belgium. Mussels dominate the menus of this area due to the location to the sea. Had I not just enjoyed a kettle of mussels in white wine sauce the day prior, this would have been my first choice and seemed to be the restaurant specialty."
"Working like conveyer belt workers the staff doesn’t have any attention for the customers. When serving wine they almost push and scare the customer away in a hasty move. When it comes to the food. The food seems fancy, but is all made of super cheap ingredients of low quality. Extras are forgotten such as crumble on the plate. Whereas the bill isn’t according to food and service received. The worst is that we (and I’m speaking for a table, and thus bill, of 11 people) got our food served in 2 hours. 5 meals in 2 hours!!! I told the staff this was way too fast and we would get sick (esp. with the 32 degrees temperature in the room), but it needs to go fast acc to them. A fast food restaurant without quality or refined food. "
"Used to be great, but nowadays the place went totally down. We barely got any attention from beginning to end. When complaining in a constructive way they weren’t able to handle it or able to say the simple word “sorry”. The fries were totally soaked in oil and after complaining the female owner blamed it publicly on a “bad potato season”. See you never again "
"On arrival there was little enthusiasm for seating us, the service seemed confused. The ribs were extremely dry, the salad an afterthought. It was overpriced and when asked for the bill it took some time to arrive but the waitress then left us for ages. I had to track her down outside in order to pay. Should have just walked out. Everywhere else we visited in Ghent was lovely service and great food. Really disappointed and certainly not the best ribs in Ghent."
"The 'Vier Tafels' is one of the few real tourist traps Gent has: too expensive and terrible quality (friendly service 'though).  Simply don't go there, there are plenty of better restaurants in the neighbourhood."
"Having read some of the other reviews, I can only agree that the hostess is unbearably rude and my companion now regrets having stayed civil.However, in my experience, the food was even worse. We had the full course menu and there was no course that was even remotely acceptable quality. Roughly half of the ingredients were clearly not fresh, the food had either no taste or tasted like pure salt or fat. I have never written a restaurant review before in my life, but the experience I had was so terrible that I felt compelled to warn future guests. I can honestly say I have never eaten so badly in something that was not a fastfoodrestaurant."
"We arrive for a late lunch on Friday the 12th of March. The resturant was not busy and had two 4 seater tables immediate available. The waiter was pulling one of the tables to one side to make 2 seperate tables when the head waitress told him to keep the tables together and let us sit at the bar while she was attending to another customer that was paying. We were handed menus but was then ignored. The two tables stayed empy but the person paying was not leaving. After 15 min we left with no service so cannot comment on the food,but was suprised that she was trying to keep 2 4 seaters tables when no one else was arriving and happy to ignore us. We were not even offered a drink"
"Booked for 18,30, arrived on time. Ordered appetitive, then waited for 40 mins for food very nice, at 20,30 they came with the bill and said the reservation was for 2 hours and the table was booked and we must finish, no desert which we wanted or drinks and the attitude was just leave fond them very rude to clients who had spent 230 euros and would spend alot more.VERY POOR cutomer service"
"Great place for a 20$ salad, a single serving of beer, and if I may be so bold, exquisitely sassy male waiters."
"Possibly one of the worst services I have received at a restaurant. Initially we agreed to wait for 30 mins for a table to be ready. 30 minutes after this initial wait we were seated. We were going to walk away after the initial wait but was offered a free drink. We told the waiter what we would like so we could eat after seating. Once seated the ""free drink"" turned out to be half the size of a normal beer / wine by looking around at the other tables. The restaurant then proceeded to reimburse themselves by charging €12 for tap water. When we disputed this the waiter got aggressive and asked us if we would like to discuss this outside and told us ""that we would pay"". The bill was €200 euros in total. Appalling service and cheap conduct by staff in a busy tourist area that doesn't really have to care about return customers."
"Unfriendly reception, food correct but way overpriced. Ground floor is unpleasantly noisy. Overall not very clean. Not a pleasant experience."
"After a long day of walking theough beautiful Gent we beowsed around the picturesque area of Patershol at 6 pm only to find out many restaurants were fully booked already. Mal Contenta had some seats left but my goodness.. Such a disappointed. We ordered six different tapas and one os us said that the bread was the best, which says enough. Tasteless .. Fantasy less, spiceless.. The guys in the kitchen messes with food and his visitors. Waste of money. If you open a restaurant do your best or open up a fastfood place. Yuk"
"foodfactory... spare ribs here are boring, the only star is for the nice sauce on the potatoes."
"We thought this place would be a good lunch option for our party of vegans as they have a vegan friendly spinach ball option. We arrived and immediately I thought it seemed far overpriced for what it was (€10 for a ball and salad to takeaway, more to have in) and we said that we were vegan and asked about the options. They left feta out the salad on request to make it vegan but the spinach ball on the menu turned out to be arancini (which contains cheese)! We'd walked away to sit down and eat and it was too far to get a refund or complain but we were disappointed to have spent so much money on something that didn't turn out to be vegan! I'm sure the other options are perfectly nice but we had a bad experience."
"the food is ok, but they charge for everthing! The waiter was very rude and impatient. No matter what you ask, the answer is defenitely no only if you pay more! The quality of this restaurant is getting down! I would not recommend anymore!"
"Amazing location next to the water, that is the reason me and my girlfriend decided to sit down. The other terrace was filled up and at Panda there were plenty of places (obvious sign). We decided to go slightly budget and order a mushroom soup and a soja soup. It was done within 2 minutes and now I know why, it was the same as adding warm water to some soja sauce or throwing mushrooms in a teacup. After ordering two bio colas our total bill was 20 euros for pure disappointment. Next to that the service was a dude who replied “whatever” after my girlfriend said the food wasnt the best (visit 4th of may at 14:30). Would suggest avoiding this overpriced unfriendly restaurant."
"American living part time in Ghent.  Went there on a Friday night.  Very slow service, expensive and the fondue was marginal at best.  There are other fondue place to go to in Ghent that are much better.  don't waste your time & money"
"Veeeeery bad service and poor selection of wines. Our appointment was 15:45 and we arrived on time. Until 17:15 (1.5h later) we still didn’t receive everything that we ordered, and we wanted to leave. The cashier still wanted to charge us for the food that was not provided because those were ‘in preparation’. While the service level is so low, the hygiene of the bar is also very questionable: there is a 0.5m tall pile of toilet paper on the floor of the toilet. As a certified WSET sommelier I initially didn’t want to comment on the poor selection of wines, but here is the essence: those wines especially unfiltered wines that Bar Win offers, are basically unqualified home-made wines, which can hardly be sold in their own countries (France, Italy etc), because the production process is without any control (therefore the alcohol in the wines might be hazardous), and is not following the strict regulations in those wine countries. This explains why there are lees (unfiltered sediments) in the wines and most of those are extremely dry - all sugar in the wines has been completely consumed during fermentation because the process is not controlled at all. Unless you like the fluffy concept of unfiltered wines = natural wines, from a professional point of view, those are just very poor quality wines sold for the ‘organic’ concept with a very high commercial margin."
"How this place survives is beyond me. It is far worse than any Indian restaurant I have ever been in. The basic Balti houses in Birmingham are far superior to this. Canteen like table's and chairs, cheap paper ""place mats"" thin paper napkins. The menu wasn't as extensive as you would find in any British Indian and then the first dish I ordered, ""wasn't available""! We should really have left then but my partner wanted to stay. ""Pappodoms"" were brought to the table with 1 small bowl each of a Yogurt like dip and what I would describe as mushed grass dip.The Pappadoms themselves had a very strange texture and actually stuck to our teeth, most odd. I ordered a Lamb Massala. NOTHING like any Massala I have ever tasted before. It was served in what seemed like a simple tomato & onion sauce and the Lamb was tough. My partners Chicken Korma seemed a bit better. All the rice dishes were served with Cashew Nuts and I had to really insist that I should not have these in my rice. My advice---GIVE THIS PLACE A MISS"
The food was good but it was more like a help yourself restaurant where nothing was asked. The soup was served with the main course & when I asked the manger she refused to listen to me and kept rudely replying rather than giving a patient hearing to what I required. Would not recommend coming here. The service was HORRIBLE to say the least. No plates were given. When I asked for a spoon and fork all I got was a knife and fork. Had to keep repeating what I wanted. Terrible experience.
"In fact, I would call it unethical.I knew this restaurant is in the tourist center, but, based on TA reviews, was hoping for local food and good local beer. Aroma has a very limited menu (steak, mussels when in season), and a half dozen Belgian beers. Unfortunately, the steak and mushroom sauce were tasteless; clearly inferior to the local steaks and other foods we have been eating on a 3 week cycling tour in Flanders. Not enough for a negative TA review, though.The bill was a surprise. I had ordered a ""menu"", which included a steak without sauce, after being assured I could get mushroom sauce for a small charge. As the ala carte menu showed the steak with mushroom sauce to be 2 euros more than the steak without sauce, I anticipated a 2 euro charge, but was actually charged 3. Irritating, but the last straw was being charged 1.5 euros for mayonnaise to go along with the fries, a charge I have not seen in 3 weeks of restaurant eating. Hi It should be noted that neither of these overcharges were on the menu.Like a tourist restaurant, Aroma seems more interested in squeezing as many euros as possible from their victims, not treating them as valued customers. My suggestion; stay away."
"When you think it isn't possible to have such a terrible night in a restaurant, you're wrong. First, we were served the wrong drinks, then the same happened with the food and when you think things couldn't get any worse, there was a big black hair stuck in the potato croquettes.This is the last time I will ever come to this place and I would advise you to never go near this place."
Sat there for 25 minutes and wasn't even offered a menu. Not for the first time though. Very sad experience.
"Had the dish of the day (a white fish, difficult to say which one it was).  It was impossible. This place looks nice on the outside but the food is of very bad quality."
"Went here for lunch on the first day of arriving in Ghent, easy location to stop and eat with nice views but that’s it. Arrived and ordered drinks and food, 20mins later still nothing....asked the waiter why we hadn’t had our drinks yet (he blamed it on an internet outage as they use tablets) but three other tables who arrived later had received theirs...he checked out and got our drinks. 25mins down. 10mins later we noticed two of the other tables that came in after us had received their food. We asked him why this was the case, his answer, “well what did you order?” We explained that this was the second time we had been forgotten and he had no clue how to fix the situation so suggested we speak with the management inside. We did, to no avail whatsoever. Our order basically didn’t exist. Total of 45mins in one restaurant with only a pair late drinks to show. I understand technical glitches happen but restaurants should be judged on how they react to these things. The staff here are just not interested and seem oblivious to what is going with their customers. If the drinks order didn’t go through, the food obviously didn’t either, this should be quite simple to grasp by a restaurant. A terrible restaurant with clueless staff. I would avoid at all costs."
"Ordered Meze advertised as for 2 people. They brought 1 Meze and 1 main dish together. Meze was very standard, calamares were hard like rubber. We explained the correct order, so they brought us a second Meze and returned the, main dish to the kitchen (octopus). 30 mins after we finished our starter it was time for the main course.... again. Because they obviously brought the same octopus, which was not fit for consumption. Maybe some imaginative person could use it as a bungee jump rope... but consumption.. not so much. The salad om the plate was exactly the same salad as in the starter plate. Then.. the second main course... a simple steak with pepper sauce was a disaster as wel. Though meat, acid sauce,overcooked... .I rarely don't finish my plate, unfortunately this was an exception. Stay away from this restaurant folks, I'm not coming back here ever."
"I was in Ghent for one night only and decided to eat near our hotel as there were 10 of us and it seemed like a good idea. Firstly the menus took an eternity to arrive, and when they did the waitress said there weren't enough to go round, so we'd have to share. Worth pointing out there were only 2 other tables of 2 in the place and c.15-20 empty tables. We were told that as a group of 10 we all had to pick the a la carte or the set menu, no mixing it up. If the restaurant had been full, I could have understood this, but it wasn't. From sitting at our table to getting our food order took an hour and a half, taking us to 10.15pm. The waitress was grumpy at best and complained to us about the tricky chef. The staff seemed to wander off for long periods of time and our wine was stowed away somewhere meaning we couldn't help ourselves. All in all it was a very disappointing experience. My mussels were ok, but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't go back unless I absolutely had to!"
"Just arrived and experienced a very bad welcome ...without any reason. in fact no welcome at all. .. and not willing to speak other language than flamish .. 

Sorry you have to learn how to host ;-("
"I saw great reviews, was very excited….and then got a bunch of watery crap dishes. Readily the worst Indian food I have had in years. 100% do not order!"
"They were friendly untill we said we wanted to share a pizza (just me and my partner). It was not allowed. We left, because we weren't that hungry and ordering two pizza's would just be a waste ... Apparently they preferred to see us leaving instead of just giving us a pizza and a couple of drinks, the place was not even crowded but almost empty. On top of that: we were there with our son (11 mnths). It's one thing to send us away, but we had to dress our child again after installing him in the chair ... Not child friendly at all! We are locals, but we are never going there again. Lousy tourist place."
"i went to Passion last Saturday (20/08/11) after reading all the wonderful reviews on this website. I was extremely disappointed. I was told the kitchens was about to close so we had to hurry with our order. I cant say there was much on the menu that i would eat so i ended up ordering 26.50 euro steak, thinking i couldnt go wrong at least even if it was expensive. I asked for it medium and it came out red, it looked like guts. I dont normaly care much to meat that is quite pink and a little blood. but this was defientely something else and inedible. When the waiter came over to take our plates and asked if everything was good. My partner said 'yes thanks but the steak was a bit rarer than she expected' to which he laughed and said 'really' he then said 'well why didnt you send it back then' -as if i was lying, giving the fact nearly the entire steak was left untouched on the plate i would of thought it was blindingly obvious there was something wrong being as i was paying a ridiculus amount for it. I told him that we were informed that the kitchen was shut. he just said 'mmm' and then took my plate away and shouted through to the other waiters in english 'too rare!' in a rude and disrespectful way. He charged us full bill and acted arrogant the whole time. I have no idea why as we were not rude once and never asked for anything for the fact of it being awful. I really wouldnt bother going and wasting your money, we had 3 different waiters and all were arrogant."
"VERY BAD!!!!
Service horrible
Food is just too small! 
2 cannelonis for 20€!!!! 20€ 😡 was hungry and hangry!!!
Owner very arrogant

NEVER AGAIN I GO THERE!"
"As we couldnt book a table, we were given the table upstairs, where there are no windows and its so hot. You can also over see the kitchen, where we witness one of the cooks, touch the inside of her ear and then continue to prepare food without washing her hands. Then we were given a uncooked boiled egg, when we pointed it out to them, her reply was, well i cooked it for 10 mins. this is as we showed her the runny uncooked egg. There is another wasbar on Korenmarkt, that is much nicer and cleaner. "
"STAFF: They were so rude. They said there was no available table inside and had us sit on the terrasse (it was December). Yet, when I went to the restroom there was a room full of tables upstairs - most of them were empty. WAIT: Three out of the four of us ordered simple pasta dishes and we had to wait for our food for over an hour! While we were waiting, they even had a delivery truck parked right in front of the terrasse and the staff was unloading dried pasta, frozen cut veggies, etc. At some point, I asked how much longer we needed to wait and the waiter said it would only take a few more minutes - we had to sit there a lot longer before food arrived.FOOD: It was disgusting! I ordered pasta alla carbonara and got a very salty pasta-and-omelette dish. I'm not sure why they put this dish on the menu if they don't know how to pull it off. The curdled eggs and salt overdose were not the only issue - I am questioning the quality of the eggs and the suspicious bacon bits tasted like it had gone bad. Another one of us got spaghetti alla bolognese and ended up with pasta topped with canned tomato-and-meat sauce which, again, tasted off. COST: I understand it's a touristy area but the food was expensive."
"No distance between tables, people walking around without mask, no ventilation, no CO2 meters, no disinfectation gel,..."
Cgarette Smoke is all over the placeIf you want to smell like cigarette smoke this is the place to go. I thought I would try this pub. I like beer on tap and pub type food. We asked for a non-smoking table. They said the entire restaurant is non-smoking except for the bar. There is probably as much bar area as there is table space. After eating here my entire family had to head home wash all our clothes and take showers to remove the cigarette smoke. It is time catch up with world class cities and remove cigarette smoling from restaurants & bars. Also the waiter was horrible. We had to get up twice to ask for items from the wait staff. and we where told later he was the owner
"Really disappointed restaurant ! 
Very little portion, basically a starter for the price of a meal, its a shame, still hungry after we have paid for 3 ridiculous meals for 39euros 
Everything was really dry, the falafel, the chicken, even the flatbread !! 
Never again"
"My girlfriend and I have been at this restaurant. We had two salad ""De grill"". Everything looked good, but after finishing dishes, my girlfriend felt really sick. Unfortunately she vomited up... we hadn't breakfast during the morning. We are sure that there was something wrong in our plate... stay away from this place!!!!"
"I ordered the soup today, but the taste was not good as I expected. That was the worst soup that I have been ordered in Ghent. Another things is that the bread that was served with soup was very terrible, I am sure that the bread was not fresh at all. I will never comeback again."
"Restaurant owner shouted at his staff for my entire meal. He kept going. When i told him i didn't enjoy my meal because of that, he told me i should go to a nursing home next time. He kept on being rude and kept on being so even after another employee tried to be nice. He even seemed to enjoy it. I will never to there again. Don't make my mistake."
"Not good. Too expensive for what you get. Cook thinks he's a genius, but has much to learn. If you take expensive ingredients, you have to be able to cook them well."
"Went in and were received by a very polite and friendly waiter. However, as we sat we waited a while and no one came to take our order. Once we asked another waiter he replied very rudely. When we challenged the rude waiter he doubled back.... avoid if you want to have a pleasant meal."
"My wife’s birthday, so we searched for a “local Belgium restaurant”, which we found.
Got totally ignored,
Food was very disappointing, totally bland and boring,
Only to happy to see us go,
Unfortunately would never go back.
So if you aren’t “local” - steer clear!!"
Pizza is like deepfrozen. Pasta is more sauce than pasta. And the price are too high for what you get.
"Friendly service from the staff, but forgot our order, waited for over an hour, only to be told they forgot it and it would take another half hour.Spoke to the owner, only brought the bill and didn't even apologize. A romantic evening ruined!!!!Never again!!!!!"
We went today at this restaurant. First my husband asked the waitress to use the bathroom and she was kind. I then asked her to use minutes after and she said to use the parking lot toilet. Never recomend this restaurant to anyone!!!!!!!
I'm not a soup guy and this place its not changing my mind. Really nothing special at all 5 euros a medium ball with 2 small breads and a rancid apple!
"We were begging for staff attention, when the water and wine finally got served the drinks were shoved on our faces as a “do it yourself” kind of restaurant. Upon complaint, we were absolutely dismissed and looked down on. As were speaking English, the female owner told our attending waiter in local language to “just give us free drinks, so we would shut up”. She didn’t realize my husband speaks Dutch..."
"Located in a very touristic place, one would think they would be nice to tourists. The bar man was very rude, drunk and aggressive. We visited the place at 6pm, not so busy but he tried to make us pay twice, was swearing and used the ""f"" word to bugger off. He then walked away mumbling other bad words in Dutch. His colleague came to apologise but this is still unacceptable behaviour."
"special resto for pasta, sauce was not ok and pasta overcooked"
"It was the worst sushi I was ever eating!!! Completly no taste, rice faaaaar overcooked!!! and very expensive!!!"
My son and I each had a plate with three tacos.  There were no sides.  The cost: 27 euros.  They were the most expensive tacos I have ever eaten and they actually were not like tacos at all.  We ate but left hungry.
The pizza crust is over baked and the pizza is tasteless.  The pasta is very greasy with low quality of cheese. Won't cone back.
"I paid nearly €20, for a sandwich and a glass of wine. The sandwich consisted of stale bread, ham, and what I can only describe as cheese that easy singles taste better than. Served with a measly gurkin. I had to disassemble the sandwich to re butter it, the butter I add was some terrible type of margarine. It was chewy, bland and completely overpriced. "
"True disappointment. The flavors as well as the service were truly a let-down. We didn’t finish most of the food as it was simply distasteful. If I hadn’t been so hungry, I would’ve eaten even less. At some point a staff member even bumped into me quite hard while I was seated at the table and didn’t even apologize. The girl that served us clearly didn’t have training and lacked experience which she didn’t make up for with how she treated us. For us it was a waste of time and money. But hey, they have a score of 4,6 so I’m guessing there are enough people out there who do like it."
"We had dinner @KasteelVanZwijnaarde for a Gala event. The place is beautiful, outside in the gardens, where we had an aperitif, and inside were had dinner. A parking is available on the premises. That's about all the positive I can tell you about this place. The fixed personnel was downright rude and clearly did not enjoy their work. The interim personnel was friendly though. We were a group of 60 and had rented the complete setting. Several attendees had the same bad experience and complaints about the waiters. They refused to call management when we asked for it so we've decided to send them a serious email. The food was just ok. Not bad, but far from special. We expected much more for a 4 course menu costing 100 EUR (wine, beer and softs included for the evening). We had a good time, because we were in good company and the setting was very nice. But we are extremely disappointed about the food and the service! For the record, I had lunch there solo about a year ago, and did not have the same bad experience. It was ok then."
"I was very curious to try this new pizza place. We enter, ask for a table, and only 5 minutes later we got one on the upper floor. We sit, inebriated completely by the sewage smell. Not a pleasant feeling. We decide to stay, although conditions were not perfect. Menus were very well outlined, with a nice dose of food pairings. We order, and after only 15 mins, my gf's pizza was delivered. Problem is, I had to wait extra 10 mins to get mine, resulting in an awkward experience. The look was very nice ( I had ordered a Margherita with Parma Ham and Stracciatella ). Let's now get deeper into this: The dough was tasting ok ( good quality flower, and overall good rising time), but the pizza rolling was poor, very poor. It felt like it was flattened by machine, losing completely all the goodness the rising had given to the dough. Moreover, the amount of dough was between 140/150g per pizza, which is nearly 20/30% less than it should be, resulting in a super thin, ever breakable biscuitish pizza (something they wouldn't even serve you in the worst AutoGrill in Italy). Also the baking was poor, very poor. Max temperature must have been around 250/260 degrees Celsius, resulting in a biscuitish crumbly nonsense. N.B. a proper pizza is baked for max 3 mins at 400-420 degrees Celsius. Finally, the topping was decent, a nice balanced tomato sauce with a hint of basil and good quality extra virgin olive oil, as well as decent parma ham and reasonably fresh stracciatella. Price with beer 18 euros, quite steep for a pizza especially considering the quality. You're better off saving that money to travel to Napoli and get a real one!"
"We honestly had a very bad experience. Not in matter of food (pizzas are quite ok to be an italian outside Italy) but the owner treated us very bad. We booked for 28 persons and instead of thanking us to bring so many people at once, he was always creating problems: he did want to make pizza for everyone with stupid excuses, we was speaking only in italian to many international people, he was rude, graceless! Come on! I'm italian, I was expecting more from an Italian person, especially in terms of behavior and treatment! This is a bad example of Italy and italian people! Moreover, we even had to look by ourselves for cutlery! we waited a lot for the drinks... We do not blame the waiters, they do their best. But we blame totally the owner's attitude. I do not intend to come back there, never! It's not represented my country, nor a good service, neither a good place."
"We waited more than 30 mins just to order and we started eating 1h later. The service was really bad, the waitress also spent 15 mins to give us the bill after we asked for it!!We also changed our order in 4 pizzas instead of 3 and a pasta to be faster, I don’t want to think at what time we would have eaten ordering the pasta too.The pizza was nothing special but neither that bad considering that we were starving and tired of waiting. If you want to eat quickly, don’t go there! The waitress didn’t apologized once but tried to offer us some drink at the end, we refused since we were already standing there for 5 mins waiting to leave.The longest dinner ever thinking that we spent only 15 mins eating."
"Service is absolutely terrible, rude and very slow. I would not recommend this restaurant even though the view is nice."
Only reason we came here was because it was included in the hotel price. The food was quite bland and service was slow. The menu was also extremely limited and definitely wouldn’t be worth the price they ask for it: wouldn’t recommend anyone to go here. 
They will only serve you if you buy food. We (4 adults) wanted two cakes & four coffees and we were turned away at the door from a largely empty restaurant.
The burgers are not always properly cooked.  The last time I ate there I fell sick the following night.  I will avoid it from now on.
"The aggressive and arrogant ""welcoming"" of the only English speaking ""manager"" made us wonder if we were being filmed by a hidden camera. The waiter-""manager"" began to shout at us simply because we had the guts to ask if it was possible to lower -a bit- the volume of his ""concept music"", as we happened to be seated just under his trendy loudspeaker. So we left even before ordering. Only Basil Fawlty would've been happy with finding his soulmate in ""Basta""."
"After a nice day with the family, we made the mistake to go and have a drink at ‘De Vernieuwing’. In the hour we were there, the owner treated us terrible twice. He was arrogant, unfriendly, almost agressive. It’s a miracle that his staf, the other waighters, are so friendly. Next time we want to have a relaxing drink, we’ll definitely go somewhere else."
"One of the worst pizzas I’ve had. I’ve had pizza in a lot of different cities and countries too.

Pizza was absolutely drowned in tasteless cheese and ingredients really poor. Decor was like a 1980s restaurant- forgivable if the pizza was decent but it wasn’t"
"We were there in 2013 and what a good surprise, food was superb, service excellent and with a smile. Recommanded this place to many and feedback was always very positive.This time a complete other story, a desaster, ground floor was full so we went to first floor with space for 18, 2 tables were occupied by a couple. Waiter asked for our drinks but could not put the slightest smile on his face, never.Drinks came soon enough, the appetizer number 5 (chefs recommandation) followed but was defrosted chicken on a stick, bad start. Main courses followed number 18 being chicken and patatoes in yellow curry sauce but this was very watery, no taste, no colours and dish 27 marinated beef with brocoli and sauce, beef also defrosted meat, certainly not marinated with again a watery sauce, both dishes were abolutely untasty... Luckily dish 18 was not put on the bill, the only good surprise of the evening. Apparently there is a new owner according to the lady who brought the bill... Not for the better...Service was a total chaos, one couple already seated when we arrived were served as very last ones, even after all 16 other seats had received drinks and food... Waiting had to be very long for them.A can of coconut milk with any curry paste and fresh chickens will do better at home."
"We also got the aforementioned extremely rude and grumpy waiter. When he came over we asked what were the specials. He paused for a long time (we thought maybe he didn't understand English at first) then said ""specials of what? Drinks? Dinner?"" We were taken aback and said ""dinner"". He then rudely opened up the menu and pointed to a few items. He was just an absolute jerk. Food was just ok but he completely ruined our experience."
"1. I like to go to alternative restaurants and pay 'alternative' prices, meaning way much more then in any decent restaurant for way much less food quality and way much less service quality.2. I like to drink wine that tastes like cork, and if you start arguing about it, then the waiter argues that this is the reason why the wine which costs more then 35 Euros, is so special.3. I like to wait at least for more then an hour to get my main dish after your apero!In other words try to avoid this alternative restaurant as much as you can!"
Hostess/owner is a dictator and demands you to sit at a table at her wishes. Terrible! My young daughter felt treatened by her attitude.
"The man on the phone assured me that the order would be delivered within the hour. Though, I did not receive anything and the phone number appeared to be ""occupied"" for several hours. Two hours after my order I went somewhere else.Absolutely not trustworthy !"
"Ordered online, as the resto has good reviews (don't understand how...?)We were happy that the food arrived super fast. Happy until we saw that:- falafel was dry and cold- minced meat balls were very dry and seemed to be cooked a day before- we ordered cheese sambousek but received something that we have no idea what it was and had no taste- ordered kunafa pistachio but received halawe Bottom line: only the chicken with garlic was eatable (not fantastic though).We threw away the rest of the food."
"The Waitresses were from the beginning super rude and never with a friendly attitude. They were upset because when they arrived we were not yet ready to order. As we were a big group I played the organizer to help. I asked her about the types of beers and her answer was... they are on the menu! in a very arrogant way, without even looking at me. Then when they brought the meals, she was not well understood which was each one so we asked what brings each as they were all similar but with different sauces and that bothered them. They gave us one wrong dish and we didn't even complain it. I asked her for an extra drink and she didn't even bring it until at the end I had to stop to tell her ! I asked you for a drink 10 minutes ago. Finally to pay the bill we asked her if we could pay separately, she answered again in a very disrespectful way! No! 5 minutes after the bill did not arrive we asked her again for the bill and she said! again rude, is there! Indicating the cash register and left! Bad experience and bad service, pay more than €150 never to come back."
"No tap water available, unfriendly owner, food was mass prepared and not fresh, wrong bill (to much accounted), and very very (too) fast"
"Te slecht voor woorden. Stay away!! Touristtrap. Exremely bad service, bad products, bad everything! Even the basics are off."
We went to there yesterday and although a friendly welcome I do have serious concerns over the lack of knowledge in food hygiene. Staff used a brown cloth hanging over salad cabinet for wiping knives and hand drying. Use of hands to move food rather than cutlery. Touching hair and face throughout...new male staff member.
This restaurant is just a tourist trap. We stopped here for the lovely canal river view. We asked for tagliatelle with scampi and my boyfriend had tagliatelle with salmon. Tagliatelle were both over cooked completely sticky with just some sauce on top and some NOT fresh prawns on top ( they probably call them scampi???!?!?) disgusting. We were completely disappointed and the waiter just said that wasn't the right restaurant to order pasta.... (!!) so why you're selling a dish ( and put it in a menu for 20€ each ) if you're not able to do it? It was an absurd experience. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. 
The menu is only in flemish and the waiters can't help you. Not very cheap considering that with the same amount I eaten in one of the best place in Gent. To avoid
"Unfriendly staff, untasty dishes, pasta was  absolutely untasty, just warm watery without any souse and it's for 20 euros! Not recommended!"
After reading some of their comments we decided to make a stop in this place.If the restaurant looks friendly we are totally disappointed! We never received the starter we ordered ... That can happened ...But when you order an entrecôte with béarnaise and you receive a small tenderized piece of beef with a pepper sauce and frozen fries you are not really happy. And this for the price of 27€ you get the feeling that you are robbed! And on top they made an error in the bill ... They charged 8€ additional.No we never will be there again.
"The guys who arrived after us, got served before us; we had to wait for ever; the food was acceptable but not great; will not visit again, even though we just moved into the hood."
Tourist trap!completely over cooked risotto and slim oysters. The good reviews must be written by the owner. Poor service. Worst meal in thr entire trip.
