review
"Especially the friendliness and happiness from the staff made my evening in the 't Klaverblad very special.The Restaurant is placed in a beautiful area of Ghent only a few minutes walk from the Castle.FOODThe food has been amazing. First taster was a surprise from the kitchen. But that was already very special. A combination of home made small nibbles. Crab Cracker with Pepper cream, Serrano Ham cream cheese, a small soup and a small bites. Normally served with bread but as I need to eat gluten free they did cater for that as well.STARTER - Perfectly grilled gambas wrapped in local Ghent ham with a mustard sauce (also local Ghent mustard). Very tasty...I have to say the best mustard sauce ever!MAIN - Swordfish steak (and what a big piece) which was also perfectly cooked. You can do a lot wrong with swordfish but this was really on-point (As the french say). Came with a nice tomato-olive-sauce and potato puree (or other sides if wanted).DESERT - My menu which I've ordered contained a desert but the portions been enough so I skipped it and just ordered an Espresso. Also very tasty (and came with Belgian chocolate :-)STAFFAs I said the staff was super friendly and made everybody smile in the restaurant. They helped me pick local beers and translated the menu for me.PRICEThe 3-course Menu is 30 Euros which is a really good price. Especially considering the size of the portions.Can definitely recommend this place and I will come back as well :-)"
"One of the best in GentIf you want to taste an amazing dough I would suggest to take the Margherita. Amaizing!!!The crunchy crust combined with good tomato sauce and good mozzarella, with an amaizing black basilicum. Waw!!!! Wood oven, less than 3 min. Perfetta! If you want to discover new flavors try the other ones. I will definitely come back, thank you!!! "
"We found restaurant food in Ghent to be very expensive, but this place was the exception. For the quality of both food and setting, this restaurant is a real 'find.' A block or two off the main tourist route, it is also convenient. Friendly service, as well."
"Best price/quality veggie in Ghent.Appelier is good for having a quick fresh daily menu or take away.For take away, BYO recipients.friendly low profile service, nice sunny terrace, good BIO wines&other drinks, FRRRRRRRRRRRASH ingredients dotted with different herbs & not expensive : what more do you want???"
Fab ribs & baked potatoes. The waiters are always going round offering further racks of ribs so you will leave full! Great busy atmosphere - recommended!
"Local restaurant and bar.  Never fails to please.  Food, delish!!!  Vegan and otherwise. Service…, excellent/ you will not be disappointed.   Cultural nouveau 🇵🇷🇵🇷👌👌"
This is the place I went to Belgium for.We went to Volta for Sat lunch and it was AMAZING!We had a 3-course menu with wine and water which cost us about 80EURO.It was worth every cent.Loved it and wish we had such places in London...
"Real meat (or veggie if you want) in a big burger with a local beer. 
I had the Deluxe Burger with Fries and enjoyed the whole plate."
"As I said in my former comment I'll be back. We had to visit again cause it was so good last time. The owner welcomed us and explained the specials of the day. This time the restaurant looked bigger after some changes during Covid, loved the new terrace in the back. We had escargots, scampi's du Chef and shrimp croquets as a starter both delicious. Main course were Moules-Frites and Irish ribeye, also both very good. Great ambiance and service. See you again next year!"
"Traditionally I visit this restaurant for lunch on the Dutch Koningsdag. It is the living proof that location is not important when the service and quality offered is outstanding. A small farmhouse in the middle of the fields, nothing fancy, simple mostly white interior. Nothing takes the attention away from what comes on the plate and that remains outstanding. The ""large"" menu is not cheap (325) but is just great. Beautifully presented, mostly seafood with Anjou pigeon as the meat course. What is striking is that over time the cooking by Goosens has become much simpler with even better ingredients that sing without having to add complexity. This is a major accomplishment. Service impeccable. Outstanding winelist fairly priced. Still lunch for 3 without exaggerating on the wine 1,600 euro. Not for everyday. Until next year ."
"We came here as a group of 5 to have a few drinks and food. We had a very pleasant experience. We all took the spare ribs which were nice, but the star was the potato with that herb butter. Important to note is when they say all you can eat, they really mean it. They often come around with more ribs and potatoes. We finished the meal with an Irish coffee, which was delicious. We would come back here if ever in Gent again."
"We had a great dinner with excellent starters (to share, 3kinds), the main dishes were extraordinary. The steaks were tender and juicy and the other dishes looked all great. I would like to point out that we had excellent waitresses. They were unbelievable friendly and had a real WOW-appearance!!!"
"What a great great restaurant! The food is amazing, the selection is amazing, the owners are truly passionate about food and about making sure you have a nice experience. Definitely recommend going here if you like Indian food!"
"We only stayed one night in Ghent and kind of lucked into this place. The hospitality of the staff is second to none. Although we didn’t make a reservation, the host was more than happy to seat us and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Get the Naan! Amazing!"
"My daugther and I gave the food 9 points out of 10(both being vegetarians), my son gave 6 points( being 8 and not a vegetarian). We all liked the atmosphere and the interior.The menue has different alternatives from the cuisine of the world but you can also put together your own bowl with what you prefer. A beautiful and healthy lunch for us all."
"The room is elegant, the service attentive. But the food - we had hare - magnificent. It was tasty, but more than that, sophisticated. Beautiful meat and a rich rich sauce. I have dined in most places around the world and in recent years can only compare this for quality with the Fat Duck at Bray in England. What skill and understanding of food"
By far the best food we have ever had. Each courses and their sub divisions was simply superb both as to taste and presentation. We walked from a local hostelry in the rain to the Restaurant and would do it gladly again in freezing gale force winds Whilst rather remote a must for people who want to explore taste. Sweet 14% beer with some of teh deserts led me to have an extra one or two. Magic we are still raving about it to each other over 4 weeks laterRead the other reviews there is no exageration
"I went to that restaurant twice already and wasn't disappointed. Last night, it was very crowded when we arrived and the hostess said we could come back in 10min and she'd save us a table.The food is amazing, the flavors and spices are balanced and the portions are the right size. The naans are really good and fresh. The staff is caring. I'm definitely gonna go back! :)"
"long time that i had a nice mael with colleges.
thanks to the good service of the hostes!!!
sheers :-)"
"My wife and I had a very romantic meal. Escargot as an appetizer was very tender and well seasoned served with fresh bread. Venicen with mushroom sauce was amazing cooked medium. Beer beef stew was the most tender meat we had ever had. We took pictures of the menu items so they were described well. Great beer selection. Very cozy like home feeling, dinner ware was beautiful and homey, something like out of a grandmother's kitchen. The entire experience allowed us to feel as if we were sitting in a long ago era. The manager and waiter were both very personable and accommodating to two Yankees from NJ."
"Tonight we had a delicious meal at Le Baan. The fried vermicelli with vegetables and egg had a beautiful curry flavor, the pad Thai was excellent as were the green curry and the sweet and sour chicken. This is a little hidden treasure with great service!"
"We visited this restaurant as we love Greek food.We really like this place.Value for Money.The inside is based on the Greek pantheon.The kitchen is half open 
of which one can see the experienced Greek chef of cooking.We will return to this place!!!!"
"You will not be disappointed here. The food is top class, refined and generous portions; for very reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and helpful. 
Note that you definitely need to reserve, this is a very popular restaurant."
"When we first opened the door at t'Klokhuys, we were told that they were full, and indeed they were. They don't take reservations due to past bad experiences with people not turning up. However, we were told that we could have a drink in the bar and wait -- probably thirty minutes, so we did. The bar was cosy and we drank Belgium beers -- Lindemann's kriek for me and some Westhalle for him. In a half an hour, indeed, there was a table for us (and two other people replaced us in the bar to await a table). Previous positive reviews about this restaurant are 100% correct. I had my favourite dish, 'Gentse Waterzooi' van hoevekip (waterzooi with chicken) and he had Vlaamse stoverij met sla en frietjes (beef stew cooked in dark ale with frites on the side). We had considered splitting chocolate mousse for dessert, but we were so sated by our meals that we didn't. Instead, we each had an additional beer.At the end of the evening, we realised that we'd been given the wrong bill -- we were given a bill for a table that had gone with the set menus of starters, mains and desserts. In other words, it was more expensive than our meals. We were apologised to immediately, the mistake was rectified right away, and they comped us one of the beers. You cannot fault t'Klokhuys for fantastic service, exceptional food and generous portions at prices that are less expensive than similar restaurants selling lesser quality versions of the same dishes. Four stars? No way! This restaurant deserves five stars!!"
"The Rambler is a good place to eat, with outdoor seating when weather permits. I had one of the best vegetarian wok bowls I've ever had there, with good wine for reasonable prices. We tried another restaurant around the corner but came back to the Rambler for our third night in town. It's clean, comfortable and has lots of variety to the menu."
"The food, atmosphere & owners exceed all expectations as it was our first night in Gent. I only wish I had taken more pictures of the many dishes we enjoyed. Naomi runs the front of the house and is a delight and Sander (spelling?) culinary skills can be tasted in every dish and every bite. It’s a definite must for anyone visiting or local. "
"One of the best ribs in Belgium! Nice decor, good and fast service and amazing (all you can eat) spare ribs and patatoes. Very good value for money."
What a bar! A true classic. The waterside location in the middle of town means it attracts plenty of tourists but it is none the worse for it. Iniside it is quirky and full of character. The place is a little small though so is often full. The beer list is stunning with countless famous Belgian beers. Food is limited to small snacks. A place to while away the hours.
We were visiting Ghent on a cycle trip and came across this fantastic place. The building itself is stunning and the food and beer match the excellence of the surroundings
"This is one of those places we keep coming back for. Whenever in Ghent, we end up at Akdeniz!Big but still cosy restaurant, we love the wall decorations.Good and quick service.Great choice of food and good selection of drinks.The wait is never too long, the pizza comes with a nice side salad and dressing and the bill is accompanied by a delicious apple tea on the house!Good value for money, great portions."
"I didn't want a huge meal and had happened to find this gem. I order their Home Made Fried Cheese because it said it was ""local food"" and it was amazing!! I was able to sit outside while enjoying my food and it was perfect! I will definitely be back."
I had a greatest experience for this resterant not only for food but also a manner of  the waitress there . The restaurant decorated with Thai  style. It made me imaginated when I went to travel inThailand for 3 years ago.
Went there with my family. We were well received and shown to a cosy table. The interior is as expected as at your grandmas dining room. The food was great and not too expensive. Paid 110 € for 5 persons for mains and drinks.
"Super lekker greek food, 
very friendly service, nice ambiente 
All of us could pay seperatly ( we were 6 people) and the service people didn‘t mind the extra work :))"
"For our yearly lunch with friends we decided to try this restaurant. It was a hot windy day, and we really enjoyed sitting under the umbrellas outside. Aperitif came quickly and so did the starters - we all took shrimp croquet. The main took some time (scampi in the way of the chef) which was not really an issue for us as we came here to chat with our friends. We did notice other tables were served faster. But the result was good - nice combination of vegetables, scampi, and excellent sauce. Price for food and wine was very acceptable. A place to remember."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Ghent, and there are lots of good restaurants in Ghent. It is as good as any Thai food I have eaten outside of Thailand."
"Excelente! Excellent service, very good food. Tried the local specials stew and Vaul au vent and both were great"
"My steak was perfectly grilled, delicious meat of great quality and so large that I could hardly eat it all after my equally perfect starter with smoked salmon. And I'm very sensitive with respect to the quality of my steak... It's a very nice and cosy place with friendly people, offering excellent food without cutting down on the portions and, to make it a complete customer experience, with affordable prices! I will certainly visit this restaurant again."
"As former chef of ""Hof van Cleve 3 stars restaurant"" Michael Vrijmoed puts taste and gadtronomical pleasure at the plate in front of you! Perect kitchen, nothingbto remark on except postive reflections! Just make a reservation!"
"We went by the reviews on here and were not disappointed at all. Very friendly staff and the food was great. Very tasty and portion size was just right. Definitely would go back. We went with family and friends, children and adults all enjoyed it."
"We really enjoyed the place tonight. Nice food, cosy and nice location, reasonable price for local food. Definitely worth it!"
"We booked our table in advance after reading the great reviews. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish ; a great welcome, excellent service, beautiful food and good wine. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Main courses of the ‘Surf and Turf’ and the Fish Stew were delightful. We will return. Thanks. "
"On our visit to Ghent this year we dropped into the Soup Lounge twice.Not knowing what to expect or ""how it worked"" the staff were really friendly, explained what to do and what the soups for the day was.Really reasonable priced food and excellent quality. Really substantial lunch. An absolute must for anyone travelling in Ghent."
"high standard and very tasty food, lovely terrace. very good priced lunch. Good service, very nice wines. a very nice experience."
"This is one of the best of thai restaurant in the center of Gent . Good value of the price Very delicious and high quality ingredients, also a very good serviced of the owner and friendly staffs.
I loved it."
"I pass this restaurant on a daily basis and the parking area is always full, it was my partners birthday and thought I would give it a try to celebrate, and we were not disappointed, much bigger than it looks from the outside and the food was first class and very reasonable prices, portions very generous, and the staff very friendly and helpful, you can even book a table situated in the kitchen to watch the chef at work, it did take a while for our orders to arrive, mainly because they were very busy, but the food arrived hot and well presented, the location is not in the town of Maldegem, but by the side of a busy road were would not expect to see a restaurant, a hidden gem I would say, if you are ever passing through Maldegem on your way to Gent or Brugge via Maldegem I would certainly recommend this restaurant, it is open for Saturday lunch closed Saturday evening, Sunday and Monday, which in the U.K weekends would be the main days for people to eat out. Overall a very nice restaurant first class food and service will certainly be going again in the future for me full marks all round. Please note that you would need to reserve a table it is a very popular restaurant."
"A great restaurant to go with friends or family, nicely located. Very good food, verry good service, very friendly staff, and thisfor a good price! Also the take away service is great!"
"Du Progres (or de baets as people of ghent also call it) is one of the few remaining genuine brasseries in Ghent and it's a top choice. Whatever you have, you can't go wrong and you can have all the Belgian classics. No tourist prices either, you can have soup and the choice of the day for 12 euros, on the Korenmarkt! Try the apero maison, very refreshing. The steak James Bond comes highly recommanded, with pepper sauce and dragon (15 euro).All the waiters are enthusiastic and well trained, you'll be treated like you should.(another plus is the large terrace)"
"i went with 4 friends on easter evening we made a reservation make sure you do before you go there. very nice place, candles on all tables a bight of lighting - romantic atmosphere. they took our coats and seated us nicely. i ordered the tuna felet with confit and Rossini sauce it was the best tuna i ever had in my life ! they also served a small gourmet appetizer before the meals which was nice of them we had sparkling wine which was a bit expensive and we were surprised because they didn't tell us the price before the price is according to the quality. its fine and good for special occasions. or for a romantic night out. anyhow you will enjoy the food and the service."
"We always go for take out, 
the food is truly amazing!
highly recomended for anyone who loves good food.
You can choose how spicy you want the food."
"We spent New Years Eve 09/10 here and had a truly wonderful evening. The food was delightful, the setting was cosy and the service was excellent. Bearing in mind it was an 8 course meal (!!) with wine included, we found the price reasonable. We wouldn't hesitate to go back."
"We went to Shibui for dinner for the fourth time this year. It goes without saying that the previous three visits had already been excellent, otherwise we would not have gone back a fourth time, but this time it was simply fantastic and that for a very competitive and fair price of 42 €. Shibui has evolved from a ramen restaurant (first half of 2019) to a Korean-Japanese inspired gourmet restaurant, but this in a very casual atmosphere and for a particularly democratic price. Perhaps the best culinary experience of 2019 for us! By the way, from January 2, 2020, the pop-up Shibui will transform into a fully-fledged restaurant ...!"
"I love this place because it is quiet you can have a conversation while dining this is not straightforward in most posh restaurants 
And the food and drinks are really amazing superb quality
Haute finesse"
A clean and elegant place with competent kind staff. Genuine very good italian food cooked just after the demand. There are also several good italian wines (some are delicious) to drink with dishes. Absolutely advised if you're looking for a place to have a great lunch or dinner in Gand/Gent.
"This restaurant was recommended on the official Ghent website as kid friendly. It was, with good pasta and meat offerings on the kids menu. It is housed in a historic building with the toilet in an old cryptlike basement. The stoverei stew is very good with hot apple sauce. They recommend a beer by Arend that is rich and sweet. It’s right on the square where you can climb the belfry and visit the van Eyck altarpiece. "
Interesting food combinations and wines. Have the surprise menu and be amazed. A mix of formal dressed and casual dressed guests and everybody having a great time. Why do they not have a Michelin star?
De Blauwe Artisjok earned its place among the very good restaurants. The service is famous and the food is delicate and delicious
"My husband and I recently ate lunch here while we were in Ghent, and enjoyed it very much! We started off with the beef Dim Sum and they were fantastic. Followed by a chicken soup with handmade noodles, and my husband got a King Pao Chicken noodle and vegetable dish. Everything tasted great! You can even see the noodles being made, and you can tell that they are fresh.On top of the food being great the service was excellent. Very friendly, hospitable, and I think I heard the host speak at least three different languages while we were there! The prices are fair, food is great and fresh, the drinks selection is decent, definitely a good choice while in Ghent!"
"Being an Indian and on one day trip to gent I looked for Indian restaurant in gent and found this gem in the city center . It was very busy when I walked in and the owner offered me a table after 30mins . I saw lot of happy faces and d coded to return later and I am glad I did . Wow what an amazing experience just like I would go to a friends house in India for dinner . Perfect blend of spices and good portions , very nice owners and mango lassi was delicious . I recommend this restaurant but also advice to book well in advance because it was continuously full one after another . The owners are also promoting g tourism to India which is a great initiative from them . Best Indian restaurant I have ever been to .well done royal India team"
"I rate this restaurant excellent first of all because of the food. It was marvellous. We had a three course dinner initiated with a small tapenade appetizer. The taste of it raised our expectations, and we were not disappointed. The main course was cod, and one could think that such a dish would be average. It was not. I have rarely had such a well prepared fish, grilled skin on, perfectly seasoned and a delicate texture of a cod that must have been of a considerable size. The starter and the dessert was likewise of a culinary quality one can only admire. The interior of the restaurant is also fantastic. An old setting with antique decorations, creating a very good atmosphere. Although the restaurant was full this evening, the setting was comfortable, waiters friendly and serving dishes at a suitable rate, allowing for conversation in between. A very enjoyable evening!"
We took the surprise menu and everything was perfect. Super super lekker. For sure coming back soon.
"Book ahead to avoid disappointment. This genuinely was one of the best meals I have ever had in a restaurant. From the moment we entered we felt welcome and well looked after. We opted for a three course set meal, several options for each course. Starting at just €33 euros and up-to €43 if you opted for supplemented dishes, it was a real bargain as the food was delicious, well presented and prompt.The restaurant had a wide selection of wines and beers and the option of unlimited wine with the starter and main was there for just €20, again excellent value of you are a wine drinker.This is an absolute must if you are on Gent! Please don’t miss out on an amazing dining experience, delicious from start to finish and the best meal I have had in years, if not ever! "
"I went for a take away! Took the amount they instructed me and at home, my family and I were amazed how delicious the dumplings were! Of course, they were not enough....We need to go next day and get more...Congratulations! The food is great!"
"a frequent visitor. Personally not a huge fan of eating there, however do take out on almost a weekly basis. Very friendly people and great sushi to a fair prize."
"I know this place since it opened in the '90, every time we visit we are welcomed by a friendly smile by the owners or one of the people helping preparing the food. My last visit was during Carnaval in Aalst (local big party) and ordered a pitta: as already mentioned in the other comment it is, indeed, too small... It is so succulent that you could keep on eating, so it could never be big enough. When we go on other moments we order the 'pitta schotel' and would almost beg for more... It is served with pitta breads in a basket and 4 different sauces. As a starter you always receive peppers and olives, which are delicious as well! Owners and staff are always very friendly and helpfull, when you pay they always ask if everything was as expected. Certainly a place to visit if you are in the neighborhood!"
"Cosy, small restaurant in the foodie area of Ghent. As soon as i entered the restaurant i was welcomed by a very friendly lady of the house, Catherine. She presented the 4 course menu and explained everything nicely. I got my alcoholfree aperitive and was positively surpised. Some small bites and then came the starter. Ravioli with asparagus, mousse of cauliflower...wow, that was delicious, perfect tastes. Asparagus soup was nicely presented and tastefull. Then came the asparagus with smoked salmon...cooked in a perfect way..delicious again. As dessert i took the trio of creme brulée, iced coffee and white chocolate mousse with strawberries...perfect ending of a delicious dinner. Waiting times between the dishes was perfect and the price was not expensive for the food i got. Compliments to the chef. Definatly a place to come back."
"Walked in and decided to stay for breakfast. My husband had the supreme breakfast and I helped him out alongside my two boiled eggs.
I think we were lucky they had the space, probably should book to avoid disappointment"
Recommended to us by a local resident. Indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor tables overlook a canal. Excellent selection of beers and small charcuterie plates for an afternoon pause during a sightseeing walk.
We found this restaurant quite late in the evening on a short stay in Gent. The service and food were both excellent as was the location in a beautiful square central to the historic city centre. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
Stopped off here with our two teenage children who had been pestering us for a burger. An interesting selection of burgers. We had a good laugh with the lads serving who took time out to give us some handy tips about Ghent (best pubs 😀)
"Probably the finest food I've ever eaten. The presentation is breath-taking and the flavors are unique and in novel combinations. I recommend the wine pairing as well as selecting the most courses you can finish (3, 4 or 5 course options are available)."
"Great food, fantastic setting, good service, and wide selection of beer.

Try it, or just walk past and check out the menu and setting, you won't be disappointed."
A really top restaurant with uncomplicated good food and friendly atomosphere. The menu was short and and highly appreciate and I beleive the kept the menu alive with changing with often with what kind of fresh ingredients that are availbla.
Some of the best Japanese I've had outside of Japan. I especially liked the sushi and tempura shrimp.
Wandering along two seats free outside asked if it was OK for a couple of coffees black no sugar the guy looked supprised and said he would bring out some sweet accompaniments I personally cannot recall the last time I ate sweets they were delicious along with the coffees the guy was such a great host so glad we went there
"The Revue quickly became our regular spot to have a cosy, enjoyable time. Always feels like coming home when you feel like having a random coffee or a small bite during the day, or having a very romantic dinner to start the weekend. The food is wonderful and the setting is like nowhere else in Ghent! I definitely suggest the ""Secreto"" as an appetiser! Reservations are recommended for dinner! "
Amazing cozy place for a quick lunch (12€). Tasty barbites and brilliant wines and cocktails for afternoon or early evening drinks. We will definitely come back here!
"The was a jewel.  The food was exceptionally good. We all dined on salads, which we very fresh and tasty. I prefer in patio to the inside when the weather permits."
"As group of colleagues and friends we have visited T‘Snackske for a relaxed time to spend together over a dinner.  It was a great experience, professional and friendly service, good quality food, nice location in a fully renewed restaurant.  Congratulations!  We will be back 😊😋😊."
"Like this bar/restaurant. It has definitely traveler atmosphere. The interier is more african style, but in modern time :) they have really nice beer, tea or coffee. If I will be in Ghent I will go here again!"
"Amazing authentic and delicious Napoli pizza. The service was phenomenal. We had a fantastic evening.

Hands down the best pizza I've ever had!"
"The entree was cucumber and apple soup and it was very tasty. The main was a North Atlantic white fish on rice with some sausage and mussels. Fantastic. The star was the dessert. Three scoops of chocolate mousse, each a different flavor. A white chocolate, a darker chocolate, and something even better I can’t describe. Very cool place. Some outdoor tables too."
"Very good food, big and varied menu, good prices, very nice and cozy restaurant and friendly service! We will definitely come back!"
"Newly opened, with the sister restaurant in Antwerp this is a lovely little place on two floors by the canal.  Great food, fantastic pizzas and clearly fresh ingredients.  Fantastic beers (both Belgian and international) with suggestions for accompayment with the menu."
"Prevously read positive reviews on TA , and so decided on this restaurant on 1st night in GhentIt was a vibrant place, busy when we arrived so we were pleased that we had reserved a tableCroquettes were a decent starter, we both had fillet steak and they were cooked to perfection, in fact go as far as to say best steaks we have had in a very long timeWith a very pleasant bottle of Bordeaux to accompany our mealService was well paced and friendly, the overall cost was very reasonableDefinately a good choice of restaurant"
"So simple and so good. Very simple menu: leg, half of full chicken. Juicy chicken! We had a full chicken and shared it, tried 4 side dishes (potatoes, french fries, cauliflower, mushrooms) and all were good. Tried 3 desserts and they were great as well! White chocolate mousse is a must try!"
"If you are searching for a fairytale experience as ambience and vegan+gluten free healthy options, than this is the right place to be in Ghent. I was searching for the answer of how can I eat pizza and not feel guilty, this place gave me the answer. I highly recommend this place for the good food and atmosphere but also the staff was friendly and they are happy to welcome our little pet friends which was another good point."
"We called on recommendation from a friend who lives and works in Ghent. We decided to take a day trip from Brusells, and boy, am I glad we did. The restaurant is a converted warehouse on the waterfront, and difficult to find down a small side alley. Take the tram to Korenmarkt, and it's on the alleyway behind McDonalds.We were late for lunch - almost 2pm, but in Belgium this is usually not a problem. They also serve their own brand of beer, and we found the whole experiance extraordinary! There's plenty of choice, they don't rush you, and as a foodie, I was seriously impressed. I recommend Ghent in general for a day excursion, and the Pakhuis in particular for a meal."
I really liked this restaurant and the people who worked there ware very nice.  I highly recommend it.
"We were visiting Gent for a short time, and had a great time in the city. The visit to this restaurant made it even better. The food was great and the hospitality was amazing. Definitely recommend this place."
"Amazing pizza and crust! We tried the Bianca classic, the margarita and the Mexican (a bit spicy but good!). Don’t try the vegan (De la vega I believe)."
"Great cocktail place! Really good service, very nice people. Cool, original and tasty cocktails, especially the ones you can share with four are fun! Must do cocktail bar in Ghent! They are also served in very specials ways. You don't have to come here for the normal cocktails, like a mojito, but's that's more than okay, the cocktails are adventurous and original!"
"Brilliant , what a menue of beers & you can also have the hot wine at the moment. We tried one too many beers & stumbled back to our hotel for nap ...then back later in the evening for mussels & chips ...a must go to "
Food was a bit expensive for a bar but was always excellent. The beer and staff were always excellent and recommended lots to do around the area
"A big choose off different Thaifood . You can have different starters, main meals like chicken, beef and fish. The curries also nice."
"My review is in English because i have alot of friends all over the world which are interested in this. It was time for a new discovery so my neighbour and i wanted to have lunch at this restaurant because it has such good reviews. Its easy to find and has a parking next and in front of the restaurant. When we entered the lady of the house was there to welcome us and give us our table. A friendly smile which gives us a feeling we are welcome so thats already a good start. The interior is classy but also cosy, between the tables theres enough distance to feel relaxed and have a talk with eachother. Inside its bigger than you would think from the outside and eventough its next to a busy road you dont hear anything from the traffic. We made a choice for the april menu, one with the fitting wines and one just choosing the drinks because i was the driver. The municipality St-Martens-Latem is known for artists and painters and well thats exactly what you get on your plate. Every dish was a small discovery, beautiful for the eye and a joy for the stomach. From the small bites till the coffee at the end.. one perfect experience. The chef uses so many different tastes and flavours that every dish was really an explosion in the mouth. The staff, Marleen en Thierry.. perfect in what they do. Explaining every dish and made sure the glasses were never empty. The lady of the house came several times to check if everything was ok. Perfect waitingtimes between the dishes and if you concider what you get i dont find it expensive. In the restaurant you can also check the wines which are available in a big winecabinet along the wall, its an open kitchen and when we left even the chef waved us goodbye. Wonderful experience, perfect afternoon.. a place to go back thats for sure."
"We were a table of 6 on a Saturday evening. Everything was first class in this 18 covers restaurant. Husband and wife team run the place impeccably. Very warm welcome and relaxed professional service throughout. 3 course meal from 0730 to 2245, so the timing was great. Red French house wine was really very good, although the rest of the wine list looked interesting too. The food was faultless and loved the fact that fries were homemade, mayonnaise was fresh and home made.Not cheap - we are talking in the region of 100 eur per head for 3 course, aperitif, drinks etc... but well worth it. Would and will return"
"Lokaal poped out when i looked across the street while strolling around in Ghent for the first time. I'm not a vegetarian, neither was i looking for a place to eat. But the looks of it, the word homemade and some whimsical dust, cought my attention. When i entered i felt at home, in a cosy, very beautiful and authentic place. Bliki was very nice to us, told us about the Lokaal, where you could see the kichen of a home and served us the best meal i haverá ever tasted in my whole life. The soup was and main dish were presented with such care. Everything was DELICIOUS, SO TASTY! Try the warm Apple Juice: you wish You could have it everyday.If you don't know where to eat when visiting brussels, it os worth the trip! It's local food, vegetarian, delicious, and authentic."
"We visited Mosquito Coast on a recommendation. I called ahead to book a table as advised on their website but as we wanted to eat around 9pm they said to just turn up - we got a table straight away. We had a selection of 'tapas', which we had expected to be spanish but turned out to be an assortment of small plates. We had the squid, crab and prawns, samosas, and baguette slices. It was delicious and (slightly unexpectedly) worked well as a combination. Great drinks selection and cocktails. The waiter was really friendly although we did have to try hard to get his attention at times. Good value for Ghent, and definitely recommended."
"Chef Nick serves wonderful bowls of ramen, definitely the best of the region! A bit expensive, but what you pay is what you get - in a positive way. Great service as well."
"There is a mural on the wall of this restaurant - cooking is an art - you can learn the technique but you can't learn the passion. Well the chef here definitely has the passion. This husband and wife team have developed a good business model where he is in the kitchen and the wife is front of house. My husband had steak with fries and pepper sauce. He said it was the best steak he had eaten for a long time in a restaurant. I had the scampi risotto. Many risottos, while well cooked, usually come out with a bowl full of risotto and a little bit of flavouring sprinkled over the top. My scampi risotto was just that- lots of scampi with a moderate amount of rice. There was no skimping on the scampi and there was also some baby octopus and baby clams as well. Delicious.I opted for the chef's special for dessert. I think the chef lets himself go and puts all sorts of little tastes on the plate- a work of art and a flavoursome end to the meal."
"I love this concept,free water on the large - shared table + free applesI recommend the balls with mashed potatoes, I usually eat here Saturdays and you see a lot of people queuing around 12:00for €12 you get a decent mealLove it"
"The bar opposite is brilliant. This place has an odd welcome, slightly dismissive (maybe fed up with vegan enquiries) but they specialise in ribs. They are fantastic as is the baked potato with gunk. Off this was local to me I would be in there every week. If you like ribs don't miss it. Like others have said, the WC is the same colour as the ribs. It needs replacing or an occasional clean. Have a wee elsewhere first?"
Found this restaurant on Trip Advisor and booked it.Had a confirmation email immediately.On the day we got held up at the Channel crossing so emailed to advise that we would be arriving later than expected. The table was held for us.The restaurant was very busy but our table had been held. The food was fantastic especially the chateaubriand.Would definitely visit again if I was in the area again.Thoroughly recommended
We visit Fringket each Friday. From all fritkots in Lede this is by far the best. The service is excellent and the food great. The place has also lots of room to eat on place and its very clean and tidy.
"We found this restaurant close to the city centre, behind its pavement seating. This was a winter evening and we were made to feel very welcome.
A broad menu, though I went for thelocal dishes, particularly 'Eel in the Green' - delicious!"
"Imagine yourself in a simple house, one of the many on the row of houses. Imagine yourself in a room of the simple house, packed with tables, some for 2 some for 4 some for 6 persons. Almost crampy. But all tables get filled during lunch.Does this sounds like a nice restaurant? No, it doesn't. It sounds like one of those pop-ups, one never knows what to expect.Well, not with this one. The name is totally misleading. It's not ""grand"" (big) and it's not ""bleu"" (blue), but it serves great food for a modest price by a great staff.No wonder one need to make reservations in advance. It's an experience by itself."
"We were greeted warmly and seated at a perfect table in an elegant room. Opera music was playing in the background as we enjoyed a superb entrecote from Normandy. The service was friendly and efficient but not obsequious, as can often be the case in fine restaurants. This was truly an outstanding meal and experience we will long remember."
"We enjoyed an excellent evening at Du Progres. We were a table of eight and we're looking after extremely well by the excellent staff. The food was high quality, the chateaubriand was raved about by those that chose it and I thoroughly enjoyed the vegetarian option. For desert, the sabayon was exceptional. There was an wide selection of Belgian beers and a strong wine list. Calvados was an ideal way to finish a memorable meal. Will definitely be back on next trip to Gent!"
"I traveled from Australia to visit this restaurant as I was intrigued by the concept. I was not disappointed by anything on the night. The staff are amazing and attentive to all details with nothing being too much. I had some dietary requirements that I let them know about when booking and this was taken into account as each course was brought out. The food was better than I anticipated and when paired with the wine, it made for a memorial evening. Gert’s wine knowledge is superb and when matched with Patrick’s culinary skills, it’s a match made in heaven. My next trip to Europe will definitely feature another night here. I cannot recommend this place enough"
"Just selected one of the nearest places with good rating on tripadvisor. The food is delicious, prices quite reasonable for big portions, good view. Recommended."
Amazing thai food for a good price. The cook serves it dishes with a smile. The portions are big with a lot of vegetables. I will certainly come back. Only take-away.
"Absolutely delicious! I had one of the breakie bagels and the Venice bagel - both were soo good! Also had a cappuccino with soy milk (Was happy that they had soy milk). The service was great, super nice and helpful. The prices were great - not expensive at all and especially considering how delicious the bagels were - (And how expensive food in Ghent seems to be) it was great. Absolutely recommend!!"
"Kind of private feeling diner establisment. Very professional service in a luxury environment, without being to overloaded. Definetely to be visited again in the future!"
"We happened to come across this place during our one-night stay in Ghent. We called up the restaurant in the afternoon to check on the reservation and the owner informed us that his staff is on leave and he is running the show with one chef, which meant limited availability and limited food. We made a reservation for 6 in the evening and reached the restaurant dot on time. Because he was skeletally staffed he informed us up front what he could serve. We order Samosas, Jeera Rice, Veg Biryani, Prawn Coconut Curry, Dal Tadka, and Paneer Makhani. The food was really good, loved the prawn and veg biryani. He was kind enough to offer us Masala Chai as well in the end. It was indeed a sumptuous meal for a group of 3 ladies who love Desi Food whenever we are together and Royal India absolutely didn't disappoint us :)"
Great food at a fair price with a lot of vegan options. The staff is very friendly too! In the center of Gent. Recommended!
"When visiting Belgium, stoping for Chinese food isn't typically on the radar...Seli's should be! Noodles are exceptional and rare to find a place that makes them by hand. Easy to combine sauce option with meat/shrimp and staff is happy to help if you need suggestions. Will visit here again!"
Went in only second week of opening. The welcome was friendly and helpful. The food and service were excellent and not at all expensive. The owner is Belgian and his wife is Maltese which adds interesting dimensions to the menu.
"it's small, it's cosy, the menu is limited, but the flavour and the freshness of the dishes are amazing. the fact that for lunch one can choose between 2 to 5 dishes (including desert) is a real asset (10 € per dish !!). What blew me away was the perfect sour/sweet balance throughout ! Also, the construction of each dish (ingredients, preps, the mix of flavours, ...) was excellent. I think this is a must do in Ghent asap :) For me, a minor point is the minimalist wine list, not attractive in any way (no natural wines for instance), but nevertheless very reasonable priced."
We had a great evening with plenty of delicious food. We took the menu and did not regret it for a second. Great service.
Really nice ribs and lovely burgers if you want somewhere easy for dinner. Waiter was really nice and attentive. Service was quick given that it was quite busy. It is on a busy street of all different genre of restaurant and we sat outside to enjoy the bustle and warm night.
"Came here two years ago, and although not the cheapest, from a quality point of view, the unparalleled best place to eat & drink the evening way in Ghent! And the staff are very friendly and a great laugh too! 10/10"
"Uncle Babe's burgers are delicious! My and my boyfriend went around 21:30h and we had a table right away, but we could tell that this is a very busy place (rightfully so). Next to 5 or 6 types of burgers, they serve a lot of nice beers and have a long list of fabulous cocktails. I had the Frenchie (omg heaven on earth) and the boyfriend had the Bacon Cheese (also delicious). We have 'tested' many burger joints in the past, but no doubt: this is our favorite. The staff is also incredibly friendly and helpful. The interior is very cosy: a very good looking bar, dark wooden tables, some industrial seats, and some cute Christmas lights. 10/10 would recommend! "
"I really loooove pizza. Every time I visit this place I'm thinking I should try something else: the pasta, the meat... But I never do, the pizzas are just too tasty. Sometimes I do regret I didn't ordered something else, until the first bite from my flavourful pizza.Starting with an Italian appetizer, followed by a great pizza and finished off with an espresso or digistive takes me back to my holidays in Italy. It's also possible to order your pizza and take it home with you.Service is great and the owner is such a friendly Italian (Sardinian) guy. Food is rather expensive, but worth it.Reservation is really recommended."
"Good atmosphere, nice location in the center of the town, delicious menu's, the white wine is very good. Very friendly waiters and waitresses. Very clean place."
"This little restaurant keeps you coming back for more. Just returned from visiting Ghent for the third time and Villa Bardon has now become a sure visit each time. The Chef patron & his wife do things to perfection here. The menu is not vast so this ensures that the food served is in season and fresh. Excellent preparation and presentation. The food is to die for. I had an antipasti dish as starter which was packed with Mediterranean goodies. I was lucky this time to have some Maltese specialty cheeses - brought over by a friend visiting Anna the chef's wife, who is Maltese. The octopus on polenta was moreish, the octopus was so tender. The steak was cooked to perfection and the roast potatoes are a treat. The wine list offers some interesting gems. They have an open air terrace if the weather is fine, however inside is cosy and unique. Reservations are recommended as the locals know about this place and it is packed most nights. The staff are extremely helpful, service is excellent. All this makes me return every time."
"We thoroughly enjoyed the prix fixe lunch.
 Inspired cooking like this is not easy to find.
Comfortably situated a short cab ride away from the tourist hub.
Strongly recommend."
Very busy when we came in but luckily found a spot. The waitress came right over to bring the menu which had a lot of choice and very reasonable prices. We got delicious lattes and even nicer moelleux au chocolat. Must have been the best in months. Would definitely come back to try out the lunch or dinner options.
"We were just second customers in this newly opened bar/restaurant in October 2015! It was great experience, both in terms of excellent dining and excellent service. We were not quite impressed by Gent itself, and now we feel ourselves lucky because we just came by this Novotel hotel and popped into this lovely place. The staff was more than friendly, it was a very warm welcome indeed, and everyone was so helpful! The chef himself, all waiters and waitresses helped us to make our choice of food and drinks. Their recommendations were just right. And everything was just perfect! We have tried quite a lot of small snacks and all of them were delicious. We were quite hungry and we ate quite a lot, and we were very happy. And La Chouffe beer on draft was great as well. I'd like to say many thanks to all of the personnel for their warm welcome and kind assistance! I recommend this place to everyone visiting Gent."
"This was a return visit to Sino and we were not disappointed. Bruno is still producing fantastic food, and Sylvie is the perfect hostess. 

Incredibly fresh food, well presented, with a good wine selection. What more needs to be said?!"
"We stayed at the adjoining Hotel Onderbergen and used Foley’s throughout our stay. Can’t speak highly enough about how accommodating and friendly Alex, Steve and the staff at Foley’s were towards us. We were part of a large team visiting Ghent for a sporting festival. The hotel uses parts of Foley’s rooms for its breakfast. These were good but Foley’s comes into its own in the evenings. Yes it has a big screen for sport but beyond this it has much more, Djs on decks one night and an Irish band on another. It has atmosphere and was a fun base to relax and drink at. We had several meals and were never disappointed. The Steak, burgers and ribs were hearty and tasty. Great weekend which Foley’s helped make."
One of the best restaurants in the region - verry friendly and proffessional service - a superb coocking with superb and fresh products . This is the third time we have been here and they never dissapointed us . This restaurant should have a star .
"This place was awsome, there is a great atmosphere and the food was realy good. Not too many but enough choices on the menu and the typical belgian foods they serve are from great quality. They also have a suggestion menu that I took and I was very satisfied at the end of the evening. Even after I saw the bill. This is on of the best places in Ghent price/quality/atmosphere. "
"Delicious food, especially the noudles. They also have great and quick service, a definitely must try when you are in the area."
"The food was delicious (we took up the waiter's recommendation of a local dish) and the wine was excellent value. The staff were very friendly, quickly finding us a table even though the restaurant was busy. There is a great atmosphere and a beautiful view of the castle."
"Very nice staff, great fries, big choice of food (including vegetarian, great value, located in the city centre. Would definitely suggest it :)"
"Last night visit will be in our memories for quite some time. True authentic restaurant where your meal is cooked in front of your nose. Steak very well cooked and service was incredible. Such a lovely host and cook, great conversation and personal service. Thank you for giving us a back into time experience. "
"The staff are very friendly we didn't book a table, but they made room for us and made us welcome. The menu was good lots of choice and reasonably priced. I had pesto pasta and my bf had a seafood pizza. We had the house red which was lovely nice dry wine. We then had creme burlee for dessert which was delicious and a good size to share. Overall the food and the staff were great. Only odd thing is they share their toilet with the next door bar."
"Tastefull and fabulous dishes, nice atmosphere with great service.
We can recommend this restaurant that also nicely situated on 'the Golden River, the Leie'.

Fam.Kapel-Sabandar, The Netherlands"
"If you want to taste India, this is your place! Incredibly fresh food and extremely friendly owner! By far the best in Gent! Highly recommended!"
"This restaurant is everything a good restaurant should be - friendly, great value, fresh produce. We had a selection of the noodle dishes which were simply served but tasty and filling. Really friendly, genuine and attentive service."
Delicious dinner...best peking duck i've ever had. Very friendly and helpfull hostess! Superb location and original dishes
"I'm so glad this place exists! If it had been up to me, I would have eaten here for every meal!!! Amazing options, delicious food, and cute atmosphere. Went here first for dinner with veg and non-veg folks and everyone was really happy with their meals. I went back the next day and grabbed something to go so that I'd have food with me while we were on a guided tour of the city. So glad I did! Fresh, thoughtful food. I am mostly-plant based and gluten-free, so it can be tricky to find food out. Not only did I have LOTS of options here, but the food was delicious. Yes, it is pricey, but you get in quality what you pay for."
"One of the best indian nepalese food i ever had.The food was extremely well cooked and well served. It was very good but couldn't eat it all because they serve really big portions, which is good! Could see that the products were all fresh and all prepared. The staff was also very helpful and nice. "
"Really nice place, good atmosphere. They were really fast and flexible as we were in a rush. Absolutely loved the sushi! Good quality, fresh and flavorful. Would recommend to anyone!"
"One of the most delicious asian foods that I'v ever eaten. The service was just amazing, for example the food was a bit spicy cauz I ordred it, the server noticed that I could not eat it comfortably, she came to me and askef if I would like to have another one less spicy.I absolutely recommend this thai restaurant for its food quality & 5/5 service.Zouhair"
"It’s a very nice place to have a good glass of tasty wine, gin, vermouth... Just near the castle, in the center of Ghent."
"I discovered this brasserie whilst taking a family visitor to Gent, which is not a place I know. I had noticed on googlemaps that the Graslei was probably a good place to stop for a quick snack at lunch time, and I was not disappointed. We looked also at the Belga Queen next door – but the menu there looked very expensive for my quick snack idea. The weather was cold and windy and although some brave souls were sitting outside, we decided to go inside. It is surprisingly roomy, as we discovered upon exiting that there are two levels inside. The brasserie was quite full on the ground level, but we were given a lovely table, and the restaurant itself is very elegant inside. I had been worried that we would be expected to have the full deal for lunch – but there was no problem whatsoever. All three of us had the typical shrimp croquettes, and my brother ordered a portion of frites, which were delicious. We ordered two glasses of excellent Cab Sav, and I ordered a bottle of water for me – which was more expensive than the wine. The service was very friendly. I speak Dutch (with an accent), and the waitress replied in French, and then realized we were English. The waiter replied back to me in Dutch, which I really appreciated. All in all it was a really lovely experience."
"If you like to eat the best Thai Take away possible, don't hesitate and just order at Dok Koon Thai. The chef and her team are very friendly and they work with the most fresh ingredients. I must warn you, once you taste the several options, you will be addicted. My husband and I can tell!!! Its a holiday in your mouth and when you close your eyes you can see the beach and amazing nature of Thailand in front of you...all in one bite..."
Beautiful restaurant in an old brewery with very good food. Very centric. Try the three chocolate mousse. Delicious
"Gent turned out to be one of the best stops in our recent trip to France and Belgium. This Pub just added to the experience. Good food, very friendly and informative staff. Would gladly return. One of our better memories from the entire week. Gent, even more so than Antwerp, is a very English speaking town and while it sounds kind of crude to say, it was nice to be there after a week in France stumbling over communication issues for days. Like visiting with old friends."
"We were so impressed we visited 3 times in a week.Tried fillet steak, spaghetti bolognaise, pigs cheek stew, chateaubriand........ all wonderful.Service was excellent, and a really good atmosphere for quite a big place.Prices very reasonable for the quality of food, we were very happy customers.Definitely recommend booking, to avoid disappointment."
"how do u know that the food is authentic? it is made by the Chinese themselves. it was value for money, as i had a huge bowl of noodle soup which was great for a cold rainy evening. the fried prawns was crispy and fresh. loved it. 吃了, 肚子饱饱, 心里暖暖。 谢了! :)"
"It is like my bar for happiness was raised by another level. The flemmish stew was out of this world. The ""waterzooi"" is like the best chicken soup you can eat.The portions are really big, so if you want to try more courses in one meal, you gotta be very hungry. "
"I went to this place for dinner one night when I found Bridge closed. The food was great and the portions were huge. The staff was also extremely nice and accommodating. From it's location, you think it would be a tourist trap, but there seemed to be more locals than tourists."
"The best curry I've ever had, in the US or otherwise. Get their early, it fills up fast on a Friday night. We were pointed toward this place by our BnB. Our host told us to look for garish signs and claims of ""best Indian food in town."" Those claims are not wrong. "
"The Staff was very friendly and the food very delicious. Cozy atmosphere, in the nice city-center of Gent. Will come back!"
Lovely dinner and atmospere last friday! Cheerful staff and a cozy terrace to dine on hot summer nights in the heart of the centre.
"I just returned from a culinary adventure through Belgium and, of the 7 Michelin stars I racked up on the journey, the 2* Restaurant Vrijmoed was my favorite!First, I loved the setting. It's like dining in someone's elegant, historic European home, with individual rooms, spacious seating and interesting artwork on the walls.Second, the service. Such a professional, well-trained group operating as a team. The group is attentive without being overbearing. The chef even made the rounds in the dining room, and spent several minutes at each table.Third, the wine pairings. I had no idea that the sommelier had won the award for Best Sommelier in the World (Gault Millau) until one of the waiters told me in passing. The accolade demonstrates itself on the creative, perfectly paired (to the food) wine selections. I especially loved the sherry-like Jura and riff on Rioja with the unoaked La Mancha.Lastly, the food. It was absolutely out of this world. Each course was visually appealing, texturally interesting and exceptional on the palette. But what perhaps stood out to me was the aroma of each dish, as I was greeted with scents of the forest or the seashore even before I had a chance to sample the offering. Truly outstanding!One of the best restaurants I've ever dined at! I'd make a special detour to Ghent just to dine here again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.BTW, I should mention that the restaurant offers multiple tasting menu options for lunch. I thought I would be constrained to a 3-course tasting menu, but there are 4, 5 and even 7-course menus available at lunch."
"We had s imple dinner here (tournedos) but enjoyed it immensly. The quality of the food is much higher than the price, and the staff really enjoyed helping us. when my boyfriend mentioned he collect wine corks, the waiter not only gave him our cork, but also the ones he opened at other tables while were there."
Try the quiche! It's really good for a quick bite for lunch. Lovely place next to the water. Friendly personnel.
"Excellent, excellent, excellent. We will return. Food was exeptional and generous, we left feeling well fed and looked after."
"We were starving after a long commute in the morning, so me and my four friends stumbled upon Otomat. We ordered four different pizzas; a margarita, and then 3 super unique pizzas. While I normally enjoy just a simple plain or pepperoni, their unique flavor combinations really blew me away. I regularly make pizza from scratch myself, and I could really tell that they used quality ingredients and all of the different components and toppings worked so well together! Four pizzas was the perfect amount for 5 hungry dudes, and the assistant manager who served us was incredibly helpful and kind. The next time I’m exploring europe I will definitely come back!"
Food is so delicious and impressive service.. beautiful location and nice inviroment. I would like to give 5 on 5🖐️😍😍
"This place is not really a restaurant. It is run to preserve a historic building and promote Flemish specialities. The fact that you can get great value food here is a happy consequence of these objectives.Do check the opening hours and fit a meal here into your schedule. This is where you can try waterzooi, stoverij or enjoy one of our favourite Dutch/Flemish specialities, verwenkoffee (""surprise coffee"") in the certainty that you have not wandered into a tourist trap.If it is sunny, you may want an outside table and find that they are all taken. Ask the staff nicely and they may well let you help them move a tale outside."
This is by far the best place to eat in Ghent.  The food is always excellent and the service is very friendly.  I have been going here for years and always look forward to returning.
"I have been to number of Sushi Palace in Ghent. This one is the best one so far. The rolls are big and generously filled by fish. I recommend this place to everyone.I have been to another place called Tokyo, claimed to have the same owner and quality, but it seems not to be true. Sushi Palace and Tokyo are two different places. And I must say I only went there expecting the same quality but was disappointed."
"Came here eating some chicken wings with friends & getting free burgers. Sweetest service, good price for the best food."
"I was there one hour ago.The local is very nice, close the city central square.The service was excellent, and the staff very kind.About the meal was hight quality of food, i ordered spanish ham and an australian steak, very good cooking and the wine, ""toro de Piedra"", from cile..special dinner!I was really full but in the menu there was a cake filled with hot chocolate..fantastic.At the end, Italian coffe...like to drink it in Italy!So you can believe..me and my colleague will go back at this local and we suggest to every body wanna a very good meal!Bye ;-)"
We appreciated the 5-course menu as proposed by the owner. Good combination of fish and meat courses. Good Italian wine.
"At the canal side setting we sat and had lunch of roast beef baquette and home made spinach quiche. Outstanding food! Freshness, balance of tastes, quantity, quality all very impressive. We had a glass of inexpensive yet very drinkable white wine to wash it down. The young lady serving was very professional. Deserving of a tip."
The food and the Indian atmosphere are always a delight when we come her with the family. My wife likes the vegetarian Palak paneer but i am more fan of the duck zefrasi. You can ask the Indian spicy but also normal spicy. I would suggest the lasi mango before and the Indian tea afterwards. Neo and his wife made a little Bit of India in Ghent.
"Eating in Ghent is really, really expensive. Most of the restaurants offer main courses at 20-25 euros, and pasta dishes or salads at 12-16 euros. We weren't on a very tight budget during our five day stay, but we certainly couldn't afford to be spending that sort of money on every meal. This place is the only good budget place we found, and it was great (and we're not veggies). Soup Lounge was cheap but awful. The Turkish place over the road (Alaturka) was simply awful. Greenway served us lovely Thai curries, goat cheese salads with apple and nuts, fab quiche, great tomato and carrot soups, etc. Main courses are around 10 euros. As a result we ate here four times in five days, and would have made that five except they are closed on Sundays. Staff are charming and speak great English (and can explain exactly what's in their dishes which is really helpful when dealing with gluten and dairy intolerance)."
"I would give this restaurant a star, that is how much I like the cook and quality of the food. BUT, the service, who is I think the girlfriend of the cook was just unacceptable. I went there always with my husband who speaks dutch. But I always have lots of questions about the dishes. And she always answered in dutch to my husband. That´s just so rude and unacceptable. Thats why since then I dont plan to go there anymore."
"Understated interior, with well prepared food. Superb mix of flavors throughout, with attentive, but discrete and knowledgeable staff. Clearly popular with locals."
"nice restaurant , nice hosts , excellent food ( meze , scampi, lamb ) and wine .
Good selection of gin's"
"We had not planned to eat here but having wondered around Ghent without a reservation for a restaurant for over an hour we tried to the Bridge. We are really glad that we did as we were swiftly shown to a table by the window and a good look out of the Church and the square.The waiting staff were very attentive to our needs and quickly served up drinks and took our food order. I ordered steak and asked for it to be cooked Medium Rare. On arrival the steak was cooked perfectly. In addition to this once we had finished the chips another bowl was served up free of charge. Two of us also had the waffles, with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and Ice cream, which was divine. I also took the opportunity to try the pasta bake that a friend had which was also excellent, very creamy with a nice crunchy topping to it.I thought that the price was very reasonable and would highly recommend to everyone else to go and visit if in the area, the staff were friendly and helpful and as an added bonus I was also able to get free wifi inside!"
"Based on the food we had and what we saw, both in the cases and from what the staff was hard at work making, I can’t imagine you could have anything here that wasn’t amazing."
"Excellent steakhouse!It's kind of a hidden place in an area with lots of green, but once we arrived, we saw that the carpark was very busy so we immediately knew we arrived at the right place! Book in advance, cause this place is so busy.The decoration of the restaurant is in an american theme. There's also a lovely bar on the groundflour where you can have a drink before/after your meal.About the food: the steaks were fantastic! I ate the rib eye steak saignon, and I got it just the way I ordered. My friends ate the T Bone steak (it's huge!), the club steak and the brochette and everyone loved it! The taste of the meat was just fantastic!Desserts were lovely as well: yummie creme brulee and dame blanche (with fresh cream and chocolate sauce!).About the service: a lot of young people working there, but all very friendly. They did forget to bring our mayonnaise after we asked, and the wine was given too late (we almost finished our food). But we didn't really bother as we were enjoying the food so much.Definitely going back!"
"The best Negroni in town! Prepared with selected vermouths, stabilized for hours at 53 degrees... resulting in a wonderful cocktail with delicate bitterness... exceptional!!
Followed by a superb meal which I will describe later 😉"
"Very nice restaurant, which served good food and wine. Smiling and welcoming staff. We both had Tom Yam soup, which was very good."
"Perfect burgers made from fresh ingredients, so after lunch I had feeling, that I ate fit and healthy food."
"I was walking whith friends and we decided to stop for a quick lunch in Otium.
We eat the degustation menu, just fantastic, the service was more than 5 stars.
Divina is number one."
A fun breakfast with outstanding service. The waiter was taking care of multiple tables in both of the two dining areas on either side of the bakery. A relaxed and welcoming atmosphere with delicious breakfast food!
"Just across the road at the Gravensteen castle, you have this nice pizza place, very cosy in the evening, but don't forget to make a reservation because it gets crowded soon in the evening.You can see how they make the pizza's which gives a nice touch to the restaurant. The wine was okay, we got our pizza's pretty quick and were really delicious (one of the best I tasted in Ghent).Definitely a place to go back."
We stumbled across this lovely bar with soft squishy sofas and comfy seating and were lucky to spend a couple of hours playing cards and reading in comfort. Staff very friendly so we decided to eat. Chilli con carne was very well presented and lovely and reasonably priced for Gent. A lovely evening.
The best Indian restaurant in Belgium without a doubt . Just tell the owners how exactly you like your food and they make sure you get exactly same . Hospitality at its best . I recommend this restaurant anytime for a great experience and it's very fairly priced .
"Just near the city center with a car parking in the same street, we've found ourselves a very nice restaurant with excellent food and service. We've enjoyed the starters, where the chef served us a variety of tastes in his ""creation of crab"". As main dish, we were treated with a Asian inspired dish of lobster and seafood. Just delicious! Also the desserts were superb.The hostess and waiters were very polite and helpful. The interior is warm and you'll notice the passion for decoration.Enjoying food and service, definitely a restaurant to go to while visiting Ghent!"
"Don't miss it. Elegant and classic European brasserie. Waterzooi is a popular signature dish, although not greatly to my liking as it turns out. Excellent service, it's a must-visit but be sure to book it is extremely popular."
"Perfect lunch, terras seated, full sun and a little wind, very good vol au vent with French fries. Very good service"
"First rate food, a bit pricey (we spent about €40 each including wine and tip), but definitely worth it. We loved the cod and watercress, and the tuna with avocado crème, eggplant caviar and lentils. Weather and space permitting, get a table on the canal and watch the world go by as you dine."
"Great & fresh food, delicious all the way. 
One of the best Japanese around. 
Definetely 1 of my favourite."
Delicious bagels and very friendly service! My boyfriend and I came here on Newyear's day and we were so happy that this place was open! Exactly what we were looking for. We were even treated to a glass of cava. Cheers!
"As a former local I figured going to a new place in Ghent is more fun. The four of us tried the 1/2 Classic chicken, the burger and the vol au vent. I had the chicken and that was definitely one of the best I have had. While a simple dish you can effectively taste the difference. My partner's vol au vent pleased her a lot too and the kids had burgers which were also perfect. I tasted some of the burger and it was really good.Staff is polite and friendly though as the place is brand new they probably need a bit more training on the menu. The explanation on what was on the burger didn't do it justice at all."
"A great venue with a relaxed atmosphere, informative and friendly staff that are happy to guide you through quite an extensive menu for the size of restaurant.We really enjoyed the choice of both Belgium and Northern European cuisine available at affordable prices.The setting is wonderful and the staff go out of their way to make your dining experience special. "
Run by a couple. Catherine at front of house and Yoeri cooks with daughter helping currently. We went early evening on spec and were delighted there was a free table. We were very lucky. Catherine was so welcoming and we had a gastronomic feast. Really recommend this restaurant.
"Lovely friendly pizza restaurant, nice view of water, good red wine , pizza tasty. Bottled water only . We would visit again."
"Great food, at a very reasonable price 😆 accompanied by 13 friends all you can eat Ribs which were delicious."
"Cosy restaurant, friendly service and the best thai food in Ghent. 
I love this place and would strongly recommend it!"
"We had a Xmas break in Ghent and booked this restaurant for our Xmas eve dinner as the reviews were so good. What a super place, nicely spaced tables and relaxing decor. We had the full menu with matching wines and everything was really special. We stayed for 3 hours and enjoyed every minute. The service could not be improved upon and we were made to feel very welcome. Ghent is a wonderful place to spend Xmas as it is so beautiful and a walk along the canals at night is a lovely experience. The Xmas markets were in full swing on Xmas eve and even busier on Xmas day with lots of families and children strolling around."
"As soon as Aywa started appearing in local media we were eager to visit the place. We're a fan of eastern kitchen but my experience with Libanese is rather negative and limited. Although it is clearly displayed on the menu, we were unaware we had to order at the register; that's about the only 'street food'-ish part of the place. The place is bathing in a relaxing atmosphere and is carefully decorated with a mix of middle eastern trinkets and contemporary design.There is a large variety of small dishes; the main fillers are the flatbread rolls. We've ordered a wide range of cold and hot dishes and were impressed. We took our time to enjoy each and every dish. The Lebanese house wine is strongly recommended!Not expensive, good value! Very recommended!"
"The most friendly and welcoming staff I had a chance to meet in Ghent! The food is lovely. And with my boyfriend, who studies in Ghent we loved the atmosphere!"
"A small and cozy noodle place in the trendy 'Patershol' quarter of Ghent, not far from the major squares and main tourist attractions.

A small selection of ramen is offered with daily fresh broth and matching sides.

A must eat for ramen lovers!"
We went in the restaurant suspicious but it turned out that we had the best food in Belgium here. The taste and quality are excellent. The service are perfect and the prices are very reasonable. It is off the city center but certainly worth the visit.
"What a very nice and cosy place to drink a cup of coffee. If you're in Ghent, it is really worth a visit"
"If you want to enjoy the Ghent favourite of ""ribs"" this is the place. It was very well known - all locals except us. The staff were charming and the food delicious. The bread and salad was beautifully fresh and the ribs absolutely delicious. When you have finished one rack they bring more if you want. We were definitely amateurs as our neighbours managed 3 each whereas we could only each 1.5! Other food on the menu also looked good- main course salads were huge. Really enjoyed this place. Right across the bridge from the Castle yet just off the tourist route. Fantastic old building too."
"As someone living in the centre of Ghent with a fondness for Indian food, I can honestly say that this is the best Indian restaurant in town. Great food, friendly staff, cosy location, and plenty of choice on the menu. If you are vegan, be sure to ask for the vegan menu - more choices still! If you like spicy and ask for it, rest assured that you will get spicy... Try level 3 if you're feeling lucky and have no important things to do the next day! Yet even at this level the food is a perfect combination of tasty and intense. It is recommended to book in advance as the place is usually packed, unsurprisingly."
"The ideal lunch option or quick dinner. I've had the burger, the pasta, the salads, the sandwiches but have not tried the pizza (those are only available for dinner). Each one is delicious, tasty and made with fresh ingredients. Though at times some originality may be missing in sime details, you are sure to get a good meal for the price paid."
"We stopped here while passing. We received a warm welcome.The resaturant is nicely decorated and based on a story of an Italian ship... (I do'nt spoil the story here).We only ordered a piza. The house wine was very good (and documented). When the piza's came a little later they were very well laid and rather large... and very tasty.We finsihed with a nice coffee and a nice chat with the friendly waiter.They will see us again in the near future to taste some other dishes, when we have a little bit more time..."
"We meet a few friends for lunch and had a great time! The place is small but beautiful and food is great with plenty of healthy options! 

Will be back! :)"
"Came here as it was highly recommended by trip advisor. We arrived during a major down pour and the manager and staff made sure we had extra heaters to help dry out and took my wife's coat inside to dry out for her. The amuse bouche, the appetisers and the meal was superb. I rarely get excited about a special restaurant but after such great service I would highly recommend this restaurant. The staff are very helpful, speak English and really like like to take care of you in every way possible. I am definitely coming back here when I come next year. So glad to have found this little jewel!Bon appetit! "
"We had a great evening at Beiruti, everybody there was pleasant and the service was exceptional. The restaurant is very cozy and everything we tasted was full of flavor and excellent. We will be coming back for more!"
A relaxing evening to enjoy a smooth cocktail and a Belgian beer occasionally transforms into a crazy dance party when the tables are put aside and the dj's take over with some groovy tunes. Meet the coolest local people from Ghent and smoking hot bar staff. 
"A cozy restaurant in the very heart of the fairytale city of Gent, with exquisite and authentic Sicilian cuisine which felt like home (since I am Sicilian!); excellent choice of beers, super friendly staff and lovely design!"
We saw this restaurant when we were taking the beautiful boat ride through the canal and decided this is defintalely the place to go for dinner. Once inside we knew we had made the right choice. Its got a beautiful indoor and outdoor area. Food was good and service was good too.
"I am from Los Angeles and this was fantastic Moroccan Food. I could not have been happier with the taste and preparation of our dinner. Everything came super hot and spiced to perfection. We had the following Harira ( savory tomato soup), squid platter (calamari), Tajines: lamb with prunes almonds pears and chicken with the same as before and chicken with green peas potatoes tomatoes coriander and lemon, the Grillade Royal, and Grillade Lamb Chops. For drinks we had a couple of bottles of the Riad Jamil. A north african wine. Once again. Could not have happier. "
"I have been to Amatsu about 4 times over the last few years, and I have to say that is consistently the best Sushi restaurant in Ghent, and one of the better restaurants overall. That is saying something, since there are some excellent restaurants in Ghent. This last time I ordered the sushi dinner with a saki pairing. Every course was very special, and the sake pairings were exceptional."
"Good food, tastefull and well seasoned.
Basic menu but everything we ordered was super tasty.
several dishes were served in one big bowl, would have prefered them in separate dishes but the table was to small for that 
highly recommended"
I had the pleasure to go the restaurant two times in recent weeks and both times I was positively impressed by the creativity of the dishes and the great combinations of taste that the chef produced. His wine list is fairly short but the chef knows his bottled and had more than on the list if you are looking for a particular grape or taste. I hope to go back soon.
"We had walked past quite a few Italian places yet this one seemed to hit the right buttons. It looked more like a family place that a chain which is what we prefer. It was lunch time and it was quiet. We went for the house wine, the calzone pizza, hawian pizza and a margareta for our son. This was accompanied by a large green salad and complimentary garlic bruchettas. Everything was perfect. Tasty, very filling and in fact we even took some home as there was so much. Cost wise, I think it was much cheaper than a lot of the local places and the service was tops."
"This was our first visit to this restaurant we had heard a lot about but did not have the occasion to visit previously. The experience was top.Very tasty market menu, excellent wines presented by a very skilled sommelier. Friendly service. What else can one expect ? Well there is this little extra : For those who need to drive (in Belgium alcohol consumption is limited if you drive) there is the ""BOB arrangement"" which let's you taste all the wines with the corresponding plate but in much smaller quantities (and price). You can also choose the menu with accompanying non-alcohol beverages. Not just some ordinary juices but a selection of very tasty juices from ""Van Nahmen"" that were as perfect a match with the courses as the wines. Congratulations !As for the menu, we had an intro ""from the kitchen"" with 5 different pieces. The best was the quail egg with truffle.All courses were wonderful combinations of the best produces. We had foie gras (warm and cold), fish with brussels sprouts, a scallop in the shell and sweetbread as a main course. The desert was a marvel and the coffee came with delicious homemade chocolate chips and other cookies.I may have had better (read more special) menus in other restaurants but Lesco comes close. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.The tasting menu + aperitive and coffee = 140 EUR pp."
"Awesome place! A must visit for both tourists and locals alike. The owners, two young guys, have managed to create a cozy, quirky, charming cafe that serves absolutely delicious food and teas. On our first visit (Tuesday, 15 April 2015), we had an amazing/seasonal/innovative/colorful salad, as well as a dish with warm chickpea and white cabbage hummus. Their home-made ginger iced tea was delightful! Best of all, they help local Flemish farmers! Other details: It is still within the city center, about a 6 minute walk from the Veldstraat (Gent's main shopping street). The service is friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Ask for tips about sourcing fresh (and organic) and local vegetables -- they are happy to share! :) Great opening hours 11:30am-9pm (Monday-Saturday). At this point, reservations may not yet be necessary. Prices for warm food are between €4-7. Unbeatable price-quality ratio. In fact, we are going again tonight. ;) P.S. And, I'm bringing my own container for a takeaway salad. ;)"
"No better place to face bad weather than this safe haven with cosy furniture, wooden floors, rugs and sofa's. A bit bourgeois, maybe, but it all adds up. It works. What works even better is the food. It is simply great! Sure, you can ask for the lobster, the kaviar and the quail eggs. But if you follow the lunch menu, you will be pleasantly surprised. It offers great food at a reasonable price for what you get, food- and service wise. De Lozen Boer is a restaurant for very special occasions. Exquisite food, great wines, nice gardens, very friendly staff. Going there is a real treat.The restaurant is not really wheelchair accessible. There a two stairs to enter the door, but there is a door at the back with a ramp. There are toilets at ground floor level, though not really adapted. If you mention that you come in a wheelchair, the staff will help you.O, and if you are looking for a great place to hold a feast, let's say a wedding, anniversary,... they have 2 halls and great gardens."
Great bavette steak and rack of lamb and our server Lisa was very gracious. Romantico view of the town across the river
"We had a day in Gent to see the sights, but it was a really cold day so instead of wandering around to find a good place for lunch we decided to go to the restaurant right next to the cathedral; I must admit we thought it might be a bit of a tourist trap. How wrong we were! Superb croque-monsieur with artisan bread and lovely ham and cheese, plus fresh and tasty soup. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and the food was so good, that we decided to come back for dinner in the evening. This was our second good decision. We both went for the Ghent beef stew which came in its own saucepan along with frites and salad. The beef melted in the mouth and the sauce was delicious. It's quite a filling dish so we didn't really have room for dessert, but on the waiter's recommendation decided to share the apple pie - buttery, fruity and gorgeous.Although the place was packed, we never felt rushed and the waiting staff stopped to chat with us. Oh, and it was excellent value as well - only 22 Euro for the best beef stew you can imagine. Very highly recommended and we're hoping to go back next time we are in Belgium."
"We visited this restaurant by chance - just walked in. However, after some time this small restaurant was full, and the had to sent people away. Most of the people were local. This is family run cafe, for us it is additional plus. We have ordered - Cote a l'Os. It was very tasty and good decorated. The service could be better, but no actual reservations. All in all, we were very pleased with this restaurant and could reccomend it to our friends."
"My family, a group of 6, ate here for dinner on July 7.  Great food, great wine, great value and excellent service.  Highly recommend."
"We enjoyed a fantastic lunch with our friends at LOF. We chose a 4-course menu with corresponding wines. We started with an exquisite champagne, followed by the first starter: sea bass sashimi with passion fruit-infused tiger milk. The starter was served with a polished Japanese sake, a very original choice. The sea bass was perfectly curated with delicious hints of lime.This heavenly appetizer was followed by a foie gras cream with red beetroot, again impeccably assembled, with a beautiful white wine pairing that made the foie gras shine. We subsequently enjoyed the fried sweetbread with blood sausage cream and cauliflower. The sweetbread’s perfect cuisson paired with a delicious red Italian was absolutely outstanding.The “grand finale"" was the best “dame blanche” we have enjoyed in years. A bucket of freshly churned vanilla ice cream with seasonal toppings and chili-infused chocolate topping on the side. I would like to thank the chef Hannes and his team as well as the sommelier Veerle for a perfect gastronomic feast.Keep up the good work LOF!"
"We had the Atlantic salmon and fish stew, both were very tasty.
The added olives and bread were a nice starter to the food.
Service provided by Danny was outstanding. Location is great.
Highly recommend."
"We visited during the party when the service was limited... The workers had made the best to bring the ordered dishes as soon as possible! 
All dishes was prepared very tasty, we asked for dishes recommendations and got appropriately good choices! Thank you very much!"
"While in Ghent, if you'd like to try something a bit off the beaten path check out this great restaurant. It's on a lovely street called Ouberg, worth a walk up and down after dinner to check out the shops and bars.Himalaya is popular and the food is excellent. Staff is great as well.The menu is a mix of Indian (samosas) and Thai foods that are unique to what you'd find elsewhere. We had the vegetable samosas, the Thali Himalya (a shared plate of a variety of curries) and the Hot Sour soup. (Be warned that although it's very tasty, take very small sips because it burn your face off hot. The curries are on the hot side too although ordered medium.... Can't even imagine what vindaloo would be like - call the fire department.Overall, it was a great experiene. Reasonably price at about 36 euro for two.Check it out and enjoy."
Visited during a heatwave so a good cold beer was very welcoming and this café did not disappoint. Stopped by for coffees during the day and sat near the window watching the world go by. The interior is really lovely and the delft tiles on the wall have a mix of traditional and modern designs. Staff are professional and polite and always received a warm welcome Cheers!
"Both meals were excellent, we had the mussels and a special fish dish. We did have an odd experience with the staff though -- at our rooms, we were told that we wouldn't need reservations since it was Thursday night. We went to the restaurant and there were plenty of open tables, however, the hostess seemed to be somewhat put out that we didn't have a reservation -- the restaurant never filled up for the entire time that we were there. So, just to be safe, make a reservation."
"Off the town centre, food that captivates the palate and the soul. Lovely ambience and delicious chef’s menu. Always love it when a chef can do multiple spices but yet blend them so well into each orchestral dish! If you had only one restaurant to done at.... don’t get lost..."
"Although we had very high expectations of Oak, we were still blown away by the amazing freshness and perfect taste of the dishes. The lunch is excellent value too. It's a small place with a friendly atmosphere and the chef is very friendly an comes chatting a bit at the tables. Before we had finished our dishes we had booked allready our next visit, the first available lunch was two months ahead, so booking early is recommended. Having visited most of the foodie places in Gent this is without doubt our favorite."
"Marvelously atmospheric old restaurant in the heart of Ghent. Over three levels, the place is a riot of old pictures, photographs, stuffed animals, antique advertising signs etc - and it creates a very beguiling effect. Especially cosy in cold weather. The nicest of the rooms is the main one at the entrance but the others are good too. The food was fine - we enjoyed our Gentse stoverij (Ghent beef stew) cooked in beer, with delicious chips. Friendly service from finely dressed waiters. On the January Sunday we visited, it was packed, with many of the customers locals. Highly recommended."
We had a great dinner in this smart and friendly restaurant. The menu was quite traditional and our food was very tasty. Good value for money.
The place is perfect for eating. The view and the atmosphere just makes you feel so cozy. I highly recommend it!
The food here is typical belgian. I love the food here. It is suitable for any occasion. I would always go back!
"We have been to Ghent many times now and this place is always on the list. Street seating, bar seating, back terrace seating- whatever fits your mood. Staff is very nice and helpful. The sausage and cheese bowl is what we always get with our drinks. Tried their Sangria the other day, very good. Prices are reasonable also. "
"The restaurant is approx 10-15 mins walk from the centre but well worth it. The pizza was very nice and the staff very friendly. There was a wait for the food, but that is expected when it was being cooked fresh - one person in the kitchen and one person serving. Very relaxed atmosphere. Restaurant filled up on a Sunday evening and was full when we left. Highly recommended! "
Lucky to get a table on a Friday night without waiting. Great atmosphere in the place and good selection on the menu. Varied selection on the menu with may different influences. Food was gorgeous and service was very good. Overall an enjoyable and fun place to dine.
"The restuarent is fabulous in one word. True value for money as the food is excellent in taste and more than sufficient in terms of quantity. Particular mention needs to be made for the way the owners Shri Nagender singh and his wife Mrs Payal Singh deals with customers. You will feel that you are absolutely special. Visitors from India or any country MUST try food and hospitality at ROYAL INDIA RESTUARENT,Ghent.Biplab BiswasIndia"
This is real Indian restaurant run by a lovely couple from Rajasthan if you like real Indian food and authentic Indian hospitality then royal India is the place to be . Best Indian in gent surely
"A drink, lunch or dinner, you can have it all here in ""Brasseurs"". It is a nice place to visit. They are very friendly and the food is great. It is always very busy and for sure when there is a happening on the big market place. You can sit on the first floor and enjoy the happenings from the balcony. A place to come back"
"We tryed three different dishes ,they were all delicious !The service was perfect ,wile waiting for your dish try a delicious aperatif and enjoy a healthy hevenly starter because it can take 10-15 min. before your with love prepared food is ready.Realy very nice restaurant!A must!!"
"Adorable cats, friendly staff and delicious drinks: DreamCATchers has it all! I find the atmosphere in the cat café so relaxing with all the cats running around or sleeping in one of the many cosy nooks and chairs. Even if you’re not a coffee person (like me), there are still many options for you to enjoy. I especially like the home-made lemonades and the vegan pastries. Because of the reservation system, the café never feels too crowded. Definitely worth a visit!"
"We went here on a Sunday evening and were heartily welcomed.After having a look at the menu, we decided to go for the 4-course degustation menu.Before we started we got some amuses which were already very good.All dishes were very tasty, a perfect combination of flavours and well-balanced with respect to the ingredient amount.The portions are good and the fresh lobster, roasted on a woodfire was really tender and juicy, everything was perfect!The location and the ambiance are also very nice, it must also be a beautiful place in the summer, when you can sit outside."
"Fantastic value for the quality and the number of dishes we had. Ideal for those willing to let someone else lead the way. We all tried new dishesthat we wouldn't have usually chosen and we enjoyed the experience.The desserts were something else. It was a sweet explosion. There was candy floss, white chocolate rice crispies, 3 small tasting puddings, one regular sized pudding (Fab),chocolate squares, a jar of boiled sweets and 4 or 5 petit fours. Go early and stay late."
"As a Belgian having lived in India for quite a while, I can safely say this restaurant delivers the most authentic and delicious Indian food in Ghent. There is a variety of choices, both non-veg and veg, and from different areas in India. The very friendly Rajesthani owners have lived in different places in India and can therefore bring the best of India to your plate. The owners take great proud in their biryanis and I can say that everything we ordered was of excellent quality (from pakoras, naans to chicken biryani and masala chai). Looking forward to my next royal visit! "
"We had a wonderful dinner at Himalaya...and we are not an easy crowd to please as my husband is Indian and my father-in-law was visiting us from India. We thought the food was authentic and delicious.Indian restaurant tend to be decorated in a tacky way, be Himalaya is tastefully decorated with lovely art etc.We can really recommend it!"
"great gastronomic experience, but the price makes it only for special occasions"
We ate in five different restaurants during our recent stay in Gent. All provided good meals at reasonable prices but Du Progres was definitively the best. Service was friendly and professional and the food was prepared from fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. We had a sole (the whole fish) fried in butter and it was outstanding (fresh). Excellent price quality ratio. Make reservations as it tends to get very busy especially on weekends.
"We love moambe! He can prepare this very good!
A very friendly host! He always come out of his kitchen to say hello. He has a good memory! :-)
Good food, good wine,...
We can really recommend it!"
This place is absolutely amazing. It is such a nice place to relax and unwind in a nice atmosphere with delicious wine. The owners are very hospitable and will make you feel right at home. Thanks to their profound knowledge of the wine on offer they can easily help you make a decision that suits your taste. Highly recommended! 
"My partner and I stopped in here for a beer, after doing a lot of sightseeing on foot (tired). We ended up having 5, because the atmosphere is great - really chilled, although the place was almost full. The bartenders were really helpful and funny, and there is good music. Word to the wise, if you order the cheese and ham snack to go with your beer, it will come with a small tub of mustard. This mustard is STRONG!!! Only have a little, and make sure you have some beer to wash it down :)"
"I decided to come back to Kin Khao to celebrate the anniversary of my girlfriend. Despite I've lived in Thailand for awhile, I was pleasantly surprised about how close the food at Kin Kao comes to the 'real' Thai food. Dominique and his team proved that you don't have to go to Thailand to experience their unique cuisine.Located in the touristic city center of Ghent they're close to basically everything.I can't think of anything that wasn't good. That night, Kin Khao ticked all the boxes. Therefore I strongly recommend this place, as from now on, it is one of my favorite restaurants in Ghent. Thank you!"
"This is the best tapas restaurant we have found in Ghent. Located in the historic Patershol, a charming location is complemented by a friendly and efficient welcoming service. The wide ranging selection of tapas dishes is as good and authentic as we’ve found in Spain. Great value and thoroughly recommended."
"This is a wonderful small local restaurant. A couple runs it--the husband was the server and the wife the chef. I only saw maybe 4 employees there.The service was very good. The server translated the entire menu into English for us and was attentive and friendly. The food was absolutely delicious. I had a seafood linguini starter and steak with mushroom sauce. I was there with a party of four and we were able to taste a lot of the menu between the four of us. Everything we ate was great.I highly recommend this restaurant, but be sure to make a reservation!"
Paul cook the best burgers I have fated in a long time. good meat good bread and Belgian home made fries... what else do we need...? the nice smile of the staff!
We did a take away yesterday evening and the food was once again delicious and still hot when arriving home ! For a very reasonable price and all home made in a quick time.
"I am a Chinese--- and I discovered the place for some time, I have tried several dishes and I really like it. The noodles are hand made and very tasty. Roasted pork & beijing cold noodles are the best
基本每周都想去吃 面条特别劲道 叉烧汤面很赞 北京炸酱面也很好吃
红烧牛肉也不错

老板娘人特别好~~支持"
"My husband and I went to eat here this evening and it was all I was hoping for and more!! The food was absolutely incredible, the service fantastic. Really couldn't fault this place!! Will definitely have to come back to Belgium to come and eat here again!!"
Well recommended restaurant. Both children as well as adults just loved their dishes. Especially the cheese shrimp balls..but not only. Together with attentive-professional service it served as a perfect experience
If your eating out in Ghent. You must go here. Faultless. Food and service was 1st Class. Jorgen was a terrific waiter. Would definantly return.
"I just had a bad experience at the bank and was still in shock. I wanted to go home immeditately, but this coffee shop held my intention and I felt the good vibes from the outside.At the inside, I received, it was so friendly and full of smiles... I am very happy that I went inside, it gave me a warm feeling to continue the day with my lots of todo's, which was not the case after leaving the bank"
"A true oase in the heart of the city center. Just lovely to relax and refresh on a hot summer day. The staff was friendly, esp the asian girl and asian guy from kitchen. Thanks for the outstanding service and drinks."
"We had the pork with spinich. One with potatoes  and one with salad. Both side were good. We added bread and it was served  with nice unsalted  butter, yum. The house lemonade was yummy. Communal tables."
I eat here quite often. The staff members know who I am yet I always order something different. The waiting times can be quite long but it is worth the wait. I recommend the lasagna.
Had a very nice evening tasting excellent foodin a nice environment. Good service. Lovely place. A place to remember!
"First visit to Ghent, so used TripAdvisor to guide us on finding an authentic restaurant… and this was perfect. Not very busy on a Monday night, but the ambiance didn’t lack, with a pleasant room and great music set in background. Warm, professional welcome from Hanna, who settled us in and treated us with genuine attentiveness all evening. She guided us on the set menu, with helpful translation if needed. What a delicious meal. Superb set of 4 amuse-bouches accompanied a refreshing Leffe blond beer. Our bottle of white wine was replaced immediately when we questioned it, and we had a delightful St. Veran. The food was delicious throughout, excellent sauces with both the fish and pork mains. The portions were generous! Some very creative use of ingredients like Sorrel in the mashed potato with my pork, and my addiction to endives/witloof was catered for by using them in a very creative bed layered under the most succulent prawns I’ve had in a long time. We both had chocolate moelleux with raspberry ice-cream, delicious blend! We were really impressed at Hanna’s superb attention to diners in several languages, and the restaurant was brilliantly run. Really nice, cosy setting… great use of candlelight. The ladies washroom was also above the norm, with individual hand towels. Outside, it looks very low-key, but as I sat there having such a wonderful meal and being so well looked after, I just kept wanting to run outside as I saw people through the window, looking at the menu outside to say Come on In!! We had a memorable meal, and Hanna’s light touch style was up there with some of the best Maître Ds I have met. Highly recommended! Thanks to the team in the kitchen, Luc and Sandy too, for a lovely authentic meal."
"Great Bbq ribs with hint of oriental flavours! Eat all you can ribs with baked potatoes smothered in mustard buttery sauce with sate flavours! Come early when they open at 6 in the evening because a queue will soon developed by 7PM., but it's worth the wait!"
"Wow! Great all the way,  very deserving of their Michelin star. We were here last year as well and it's still the same , delicious and service that's personal and professional."
"Creative cooking, well presented and friendly service. Restaurant vibe is low key, nothing pretentious, pitched just right. The two ladies in the front of house, attention and level of service is warm and friendly. Well done to the boys in the kitchen too. Beats lots of restaurants of similar style in London with Michelin stars. ! Well done."
"I love Indian food, and several vegans had told me to go here. Loved the food, the friendly and helpful staff, the many wonderful vegan options! I recommended it to all my vegan friends, I'm sure they will love it too!"
"A beautiful intimate charming restaurant with character, great food, large portions. My favourite over the few days we were there. 6 of us walked in, no problem, accommodated us well. Lovely staff.."
"My husband wanted gourmet burgers... I wanted the Chinese next door... Glad I let him decide!! The service was exceptional, the food was amazing, and I loved the style of the place. We will most definitely be returning here again!"
"What a wonderful restaurant. The difference is immediate as you walk in the door. There are two rooms, one that goes back quite a long way with lots of light, glass panels and mirrors. The other room is bit more like a library as the walls are covered in books, out of the two it is the quietest. For the food what can I say but ribs, ribs, ribs and wonderful they are. The jacket potato with curry sauce and salad are welcome breaks to this meat fest. One of the options include two glasses of wine, you are given a 1.5 litre bottle of your choice red or white and you can drink as much as you like. After you have gone past your two glasses you pay by the centimetre, very different. At weekends it is best to book which you can do online. The staff are very friendly and their English is excellent. Thanks Amadeus I am going to miss you. "
"A good place to meet friends. Cozy, not expensive and easy.
Can cook delicious meat. In general, the kitchen is fine."
"This place serves vegetarian and vegan food: burgers, salads, wraps, sandwiches and cakes. Firstly we tried burgers and those were best vegan burgers I ate! Holding shape, flavourful, with fresh crunchy salad and on a lovely bun. Plus different than the falafels that seem to be the main veggie option in so many places. I especially liked the Mexican smoked Jalapeno burger but the red pepper one was also delicious. On the other occasions I tried the vegan sandwiches to go. The leek with smoked tofu was great and so was the curry spread. Both served with crunchy baguette and so much salad that will fulfil your cravings for greens. Definitely recommend. I'm going to be back whenever I'm in Belgium. "
"We had great local food well cooked and very tasty, great beer selection too."
"We had takeaway from this place when staying at a nearby place. The restaurant is run by a friendly couple from North India.

Food was tasty and without any excess of oil and spices."
The pastel de nata was amazing ! Also the owner is very kind ! A perfect place to have a sweet break. I will come back!
The place is excellent. The food is really good and also the staff is really well organized.  Remember that you need to reserve a table to eat here.
"Good food,especially the green eel, fabulous view and good service. Not overpriced! Somehow the gps missed the location ( no outside sgneage)"
"After spending some time looking for a restaurant that still had place on a Friday evening (without reservation), we stumbled across this little place. It didn't have space left, but a couple that had just finished eating was so friendly to finish their wine on the outside terrace, so we could have theirs. The guy at the bar seemed to have decided he wanted to give us an unforgettable time, because from the beginning on, he was very charming. Due to the 2th lockdown approaching, he also handed out free dessert, let us taste their sakés, and gave us homemade soda to take home. The food itself was delicious, just what we needed, and not expensive at all. We will definitely return, and recommend this place to friends and family."
We had the 7 course meal which was fantastic. Nice stylish restaurant with a great host and sommelier. You should try it!
"This restaurant closes later than almost any other restaurant in Ghent, so if you are used to have tour dinner later than 7 or 8 pm, you should have it here. The food is very good as the service."
This is a small restaurant in a modern hotel. The menu is limited but the food was interesting and well-cooked. Excellent service from the staff who gave helpful advice on local beers (sampled Gruut - a Ghent beer - for the first time). Not a historic or atmosphere restaurant but it worked well for a relaxed business dinner.
"We once again had a very ""good morning"" in the Indian Curry House. Delicious food and very friendly staff!"
"I rarely give 5 stars but Du Progrès is really a nice place. I was invited here for the first time by chance, but since then have come back about five times each time I was in Gent. The steak is really good indeed, but what I really appreciate is the great service. Once it was full and I was told to come back in 30' which I did, and I had my table. Waiters speak several languages which can be helpful. In summer you can sit outside and the location is great as well."
"Was here for dinner with friends, very original and Delicious tasty creations. We took the 4 course dinner including wine and Received 3 different wines and for every wine they refilled our glasses once, so they aren’t cheap in providing you sufficient wine. However, the food portions could have been a bit larger. We didn’t go home hungry, but I would suggest not skipping lunch at home if you plan to go for dinner here. Like another reviewer suggested: portions could be a bit larger. Or maybe they could offer also a 5 course dinner in the future. Despite the portion sizes I see no reason to not give 5 stars."
"I am a food lover. I quite often visit the Indian restaurants. Yesterday I have visited himalaya with my friends and the food was awesome. Day was busy though, but friendly staffs were giving their best. I would visit this place next time for sure.My friends are now the great fan of juicy MOMO.A lovely place indeed with ancient Nepali art and crafts gives the Asian vibes.I strongly advice thali Himalaya to try once. Good price good food good mood. I'm pitty sure that this is the best restaurant in Gent for Indian and Nepali foods."
"From the moment we walked in, this place was amazing. Friendly service!!! The food was amazing, creative, fresh, perfectly seasoned - every single dish was memorable."
"One of the best restaurants (type Brasserie, not fine dining). The food is delicious and top quality. The chef and his team are very friendly and welcoming. The wine list and selection is just amazing. A wine lovers paradise. The price of food is perhaps on the expensive side but it is usually worth it! Please go and enjoy. Even the sight across the street is worth it. But you have to see it yourself :-)."
"Wonderful food very nice, portion of reasonable size when looking at price. The food has excellent tastes and great textures. Had an amazing dinner at porto belfino from the starter to the desert amazing. This is definitely a place you should eat at when in Sint Niklaas. If i visit this place again they will see me again for sure"
"The only thing better than the food was the service. We sat inside, downstairs, and found the atmosphere perfect (the upstairs was a little hot). We had the mussels and the stew and found them both perfect. The price was very average in comparison to others in the area. We would highly recommend."
"The whole dinner was fantastic. The man treated us perfectly and was kind of familiar to me, I felt really comfortable. He helped us choosing our meal and he was completely right with the recommendation. The meal came pretty early and the wait was nice and short. Finally, the prices are great. As a conclusion, I do totally recommend you coming to this restaurant, I spent a great night in a perfect and warm atmosphere in the heart of Gand"
"Good coffee, and excellent omelette! They still make an omelette how it's suppose to be done and that is rare.Service very good and very friendly.We were in the Ibis hotel nearby, but we had our breakfast/brunch/lunch here. It is much better and fresher here."
"Royal India is a small restaurant on a side street in Ghent. It was rated #1 Indian food restaurant in Ghent for good reason. We ordered the chicken mango, lamb vindaloo, and garlic naan. The chicken mango was the best I have ever had. The combination of mango, citrus, ginger, and chicken was superb. The lamb vindaloo had just the right amount of spice, which you can change if you like. The lamb was amazingly tender and subtle flavor of fennel. The garlic naan had just the right amount of garlic nd was delicious. The staff were friendly leading to a wonderful visit. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. Go there! You won't be disappointed. "
"I’ve already tried all the burgers and I like them all! They’re all packed with flavour and are prepared on homemade buns. The service is also excellent, the owner is very friendly and appreciates  feedback on his products.
I’ll most certainly keep eating here!"
"We had some great food here. I had some delicious shrimp and everything from fries to veggies to sauce was so good. We were very comfortable and relaxed there as well, nice atmosphere and service"
Food is very good and restaurant is in great location.  ! The service was fast and efficient  and menu was comprehensive.   Ideal place for winter time
"Great quality restaurant, nice for special occasions. Very good service. The restaurant specializes in meat and they are perfectly cooked."
"Very good burgers with enough choice and good atmosphere. If you're into burgers, this is the place to go to when visiting Gent."
"I visited this pub with some friends at night. The first thing I noticed was the amount of unique objects all over the place. Everywhere I looked, something would grab my attention. There were bikes above my head, candles and lanterns across the tables, and books and statues along the walls. The owner was very friendly and introduced me to Belgium beer (first time I ever liked beer, to the annoyance of my German husband). The overall place had a friendly and relaxing vibe. There was a sweet cat who roamed the place too. I got quite drunk with my friends and met some lovely people who were also there that night. I would definitely go again, I enjoyed myself so much."
"We ate here on a sunday evening. Nice cosy relaxed atmosphere overlooking the square. The beef stew was rich in flavour, with the meat so tender. The stew was plentiful, served in a small La Creuset pot to keep it hot. Vegetables were fresh and well prepared."
"When we tried to eat lunch there we were told, rather abruptly, that it was impossible without a reservation! In the mood for Italian food we tried again that evening, even though we did not have a reservation....and are we ever glad we did. The place was humming with what appeared to be a happy crowd and wonderful fragrances. The pizza and salad we ordered were fresh and delicious....and the service was good. We talked to the couple at the table next to us who said they eat there once a week...and it usually is hard to get in without a reservation. It seems that many of the people who eat there are regulars...who feel like part of a big family. So glad we were able to experience it...one of the best meals we have had so far - 10 days into our 3 week trip."
"We travel a lot and us both being ""sushi lovers"" wherever we travel we always look for a great sushi restaurant. A search on Tripadvisor reccomended Tokyo Sushi Gent. We went her for dinner and I can highly reccomend this restaurant! The restaurant and the atmosphere is calm, relaxed and welcoming. The sushi tasted fresh, delicoius and looked fantastic. Probably one of the best sushi meals I`ve had. The menu comes with a lot of different to choose from and if you are from 3 persons up I`d reccomend to try their ""Titanic"" - a ship filled with sushi, maki and sashimi. Highly reccomended restaurant in Gent!"
This restaurant is a short walk from the main station and is easily accessible from the central area. The chicken and mushroom soup was tasty and thoroughly enjoyable. I hen had the beef curry. The meat was almost dissolving and the taste was wonderful. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the staff were very helpful. Service was quick but not hurried. I would certainly visit again when I am in the area. 
"- Very good chinese food
- Open untill late in the evening
- Very friendly service
- Large portions
- Tip: choose a menu"
"excellent food en wines went with friends for dinner and was superb
clean en nice resto personaal 1 st class we had cote a l'os  de best we never had
resto to be recommend to friends etc"
"This is the place to be when everything else is closed. Here you can still find something to eat and ..... it's nice eating. Great steaks, nice portions, cosy place !"
"Back for the first of this years visits. Started with the lentil soup. Then asked if we could share a main of lamb chops, not a problem. As usual everything is served piping hot,the waiting staff are excellent. The food is delicious. Looking forward to our return visit on Sunday evening."
"This repurposed building is a perfect setting for a wonderful evening. Just make sure you book ahead because this is a very popular restaurant. I tried to book online the day of & it was full; the local hotel called & secured the last table. Every table was filled with both locals & tourists. The staff is very attentive and went out of their way to be friendly. The food was very good. I ordered oysters that were amazing & fresh! Instead of my accustomed horseradish & spicey seafood sauce I learned to eat them with vinegar & diced shallots in the local tradition! The spring delicacy, local white asparagus prepared Flemish style, was delicious. The pan sauteed Dover Sole was amazing. You can check out the daily market menu on their website: http://www.pakhuis.be/en/"
Sat here today in sunshine for drinks. Excellent service from a very efficient waitress who had the art of seeing exactly when you required service. Highly recommend. A great find.
"June 2nd lived a top culinary experience at this restaurant.The hotel is conveniently located only a short distance from the Antwerp/Knokke highway in a semi modern building which is nicely decorated.The chef himself came along the explain the extended menu and to inquire whether we had any problems with the menu.We had 3 top 'appetizers' with the apéritif - one based on sardines with tomato and goat cheese - one as a variation on the 'vitello tonato' concept and one based on ox-tongue, ravioli and bouillabaise - all top preparations.The menu itself started with a fish preparation - very nice and continued with a very nice sheep meat dish.Then we had a top notch creative cheese platter followed by 2 very nice desserts - one based on strawberry and one based on apple - just great.It was also great that a number of good quality wines could be ordered by the glass - which we did - and these were served in absolutely correct quantities.We had a top experience - thanks to the chef and his team and the staff taking care of the service."
"A couple of years ago I reviewed this restaurant and had nothing but good things to say about it. Well the fact is that we ate there yet again on Friday evening and I have to report that it s still my favourite Chinese restaurant in The Flanders. Granted, I have no idea if the dishes really are what you would eat in China, but I can tell you that the Peking duck I had on Friday evening was simply out of this world and that I will be having this dish again and hopefully not in the too distant future. The restaurant interior is and remains nothing short of classy but also very inviting. There is a certain ambiance that reigns here that lends itself to long drawn out meals, good company and an after dinner drink. The staff is friendly, extremely helpful and very attentive. We also particularly enjoyed the recommended wine of the week selection which was, I believe, a French Red Grenache wine from the Rhone region at an exceedingly reasonable price. Chapeau..."
"Dont expect a big cosy restaurant but most important of all is that you get good decent Asian food. Space is very small and there are not many seats so if you want to be sure you can sit down in the back make sure you make reservation. But even in a small place you can make great food and give excellent service. The proof is here...very friendly owners who will explain things to you when you ask even when its really busy. You feel these people are thinkiçng about their food and customers. The food comes fast, dim sum as starter..delicious. Waiting time is normal altough they will tell you when it takes a bit longer. The price...well i think you wont find much cheaper..and for really quality food. Loved everything..definatly place to come back."
Best sushi bar ever I had visited in gent.fresh and fast service with friendly people.Eager to visit next time.
"If you want to have a healthy ""fast food"" go over there. You get lovely and tasty veggie burgers in very short time with a mountain of fresh vegetables. I recommend this lovely little place to everybody."
"The Miso soup was fantastic as was our main course of grilled sweet chicken and fluffy rice. I saw sushi arrive at another table and told myself next time I visit to check it out. Very impressed for a first time, unsure to try it visit. Will be back for sure!"
Fantastic range of beers. Great atmosphere and good location next to the canal. Very friendly and helpful staff.
My husband and I came here based on TripAdvisor reviews and the fact that they had many vegan choices. We were not disappointed. The food was absolutely stunning. The vegan massaman curry was to die for. The service was also excellent and the staff spoke perfect English. We would highly recommend this restaurant. 
"If you are looking for a restaurant to enjoy the local beef stew, look no further that’s probably the best in Ghent."
"Lovely sushi 🍣 wonderfull service,we have fantastic time at this place.one of the best sushi restaurants at Ghent fully recommendation."
"We ate a late dinner around 9 PM here and it was delicious. All you can eat spare ribs in the heart of old town. Just a block away from the Marriott on a beautiful evening stroll. Nice indoor seating, very cozy atmosphere, and great wait staff provided a wonderful evening of casual dining. Served with salad, potatoes, and 4 sauces it was more than enough to eat. I suggest the ""Salty and Spicy"" variety."
"Went to Godot restaurant tonight for dinner in Gent and were not disappointed. Wait staff were attentive, polite and service was excellent. We had four pasta dishes, ravioli, pasta with pesto and linguine with clams. All were perfectly cooked with fresh pasta, served hot and very short wait times. Price for 4 people with beverages came to 74 Euro. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."
Joined our friends for a celebratory meal and the buzz as we entered the restaurant was palpable. Lovely cocktails got the evening started. Great selection in the wine list and the food was generous portion sizes. The staff were multi lingual and so were very helpful in the decisions made by my fellow diners. I loved this place and would happily visit it again when we are next in Ghent.
"Had the set lunch for 15 euro,s , we had soup and a steak. Both were excellent. Really nice surroundings and a lovely cellar which looks like it has been preserved from years ago. Would definitely go back to Ghent and eat here again."
"Seriously... this is the most interesting bar / bike museum I have ever been to in all of my travels. The bar is filled with old bicycles hanging from the ceiling and old lamps on the tables. Don't mind that the entire place is filled to the brim with junk since the owner is a serious horder and hasn't cleaned or thrown anything away in the past 25 years. There is only one choice of beer and this weeks choice was Delirium Tremens which is always tasty. We got to spend a little time by the fire, were able to pet the owners cat, and have a little chat with the owner. We can't decide if he has gone crazy or is a genius. Either way.... you must stop here if you are ever in Ghent."
"I've been a regular visitor of De Verloren Hoet for a couple of years now, and I hope many more years will follow.The menu is not the largest but it offers some absolutely mouthwatering dishes for each course. The cuisine can be described as classic Belgian/French without being overly frivolous and without trying too hard to stand out. Instead what you get are perfectly executed dishes, time and time again. The snails, moules du chef, croquettes crevettes, onglet etc all are delicious - definitely try them!The interior is authentic and easy going, making this the perfect place for a Friday night diner with your loved one(s) or friends."
"Best tacos and quesadillas in a beautiful, colourful atmosphere, with warm people and good music.
Have a Mezcal Margarita, Dark & Stormy, tequila (or 5)!
What else do you want on a night out?"
We were pleasantly surprised to find authentic North Indian food in Ghent! Would recommend it to anyone looking for good Indian food in Ghent.
"Spent a good few hours in here on a Wednesday night and had a fantastic evening. A small bar area with a huge cellar. It has a good mix of friendly locals and tourists.It has a good beer selection and some of the nicest bar staff you could wish to meet. So a big shout out to Johan (Joe, we hope your operation goes well) and Clair who kept us fully entertained.Excellent night and a great bar!"
"Couldn't wait to get some Belgium waffles. This place had good reviews so thought I would give it a try. Did not disappoint!!! The waffles were slightly crisp on the outside, and moist on the inside. Get the ones with strawberries and whipping cream on top! You won't be disappointed!"
Located at the village square of Temse the Gulden Cop welcomes you for a nice meal or a big choice of Belgian beers.
"The place doesn't look very promising from outside, but once you enter, you feel like being in another era. There are places inside as well as in the exterior, but, when we ate there, it was very crowded so we barely found a table. There are a lot of options for breakfast (or lunch if you want) with some predefined menus. The quality is good and the personnel is very nice.You can spend a quality morning there before visiting the centre of Gent. "
"Wanting to try the local speciality, we decided to visit this café, centrally situated near the cathedral.  We had waffles with chocolate sauce and ice cream for 7 euros, money well spent.  We washed them down with lemon tea.  The proprietor has an excellent sense...More"
The restaurant is tucked away in the medieval Petershol district behind an unassuming green door. The decor is intimate and cosy. The food is fantastic and amazing value. There is a choice of 3 or 4 starters and the same for mains. Then a dessert or cheese board. The quality is excellent and only €33 or €53 with aperitif and wine. (A couple of the dishes have €4 supplements). Good sized portions beautifully presented Flemish fayre. The service was excellent. Friendly and attentive. The co-owner explained each dish to us in English. Highly recommend. 
"We were a group of 4 and came after 13:00 on a Saturday, so the restaurant was not crowded anymore and we were able to enjoy a wide and delicious variety of Indian dishes from the buffet menu. On weekdays the all-you-can-eat buffet (minus the drinks) is around 10 euro and on on weekends 4 euro more, thus something around 14. The food was fresh and there were plenty of options for both the meat lovers (chicken and lamb) and vegetarians (tofu and spinach dishes, salads, rice dishes, etc.). Highly recommend this family-run restaurant."
"Excellent sushi restaurant, the food and service is very nice.  I recommended this for people who love tho eat sushi"
"I'll usually stop by at Ellis Gourmet Burger whenever I'm in Ghent, and I've never been disappointed.First things first: How's the food? They've got a wide range of burgers, and a lot of them offer a fancy twist on the classic fare. I personally love the Bacon, Chili and Blue Cheese burgers, and I'm sure there's at least one for everyone's taste. In my experience, the meat's always been cooked well (but DO state your preference: say so if you want it on the rare side). The buns and toppings are very nice. I'll always order the Belgian fries (they're great), and even the mayo is a treat. As a side note: I'll have a beer with my burger (hard to go wrong there) but my SO loves the home-made iced tea.You're in a rather touristy part of town here, but their prices shouldn't break the bank. Sure, the fast food giant around the corner may be a bit cheaper, but you'll get what you paid for.The staff are always friendly, and service reasonably quick (surprisingly so, depending on the time of day). On the very rare occasion something went wrong, they were quick to offer complimentary drinks.I'm a fan of the interior decoration -- which fits their overall style -- but when it's sunny, they're perfectly located if you want to sit outside indulge in some people-watching.TL/DR: If you're in Ghent, and you're in the mood for a nice (and reasonably priced) burger with some Belgian fries on the side, Ellis Gourmet Burger does what it says on the tin (with a smile). Highly recommended!"
We went here based on other TA reviews and were not disappointed. Starters of scampi in 'maison' sauce and garlic mushrooms on toast were delicious. For mains we had salmon tagliatelli and spaghetti carbonara. Both were amazing! Really nice meal would definitely recommend.
Food is 'real' Thai food.. cooked by a Thai. And service is 'customer focused'. Feels like coming home over and over.
"Visited this resturant many times in the past ,nice to see the service ,staff and food are just as good as always.Good food reasonable prices considering it is on one of the main squares of Ghent,Tip..try the"" dag menu"" ...soup and a main course for between 12 and 14 euro depending on the dish."
"Had an excellent lunch here,and the service was so friendly,we decided to return for our dinner.Again,the service was excellent.We opted for local dishes,Waterzooi (a tasty,homely chicken broth) and beef cheeks slow cooked in local beer,and a fiery prawn dish.Good full bodied red,and yummy pudding.Booking advised at weekends."
Only used this café for breakfast.Great quality and well pricedThe royal breakfast is a continental breakfast lovers dream at 10 euros and the wife who only eats a small breakfast was catered for with wholemeal toast and coffee.My friends had omelettes and said they were also excellent.The coffee is also strong and just what you need.
"There was nothing not to like about this property, The restaurant itself is comfortably laid out and has a relaxed air about it. We were warmly greeted on arrival and taken through the menu for the evening. Every course was a delight to the eye and to the palate. The wine pairings all worked well. It was clear to us that service was as important as the food - both were outstanding."
"During the last day of the ""Gentse Feesten"", the main annual party event in Ghent, this picturesque terrace really piqued our interest when strolling around looking for a place to eat. It appeared not only pleasant on the eye but to our palate as well. A delicious and inexpensive taste of Sicily! And even though the place was packed (I counted 13 tables with an average of 4 people per table on my way to the bathroom) we were served in about 15-20 minutes. Served with a smile, of course. Coincidence – does that exist? – has it that a young and talented accordion player sat just meters away playing the entire time we were sitting on that lovely terrace. For a moment, we were submerged in a lovely Italian neighbourhood tasting the local specialities. We ordered a bottle of water, 1/4L of wine, she had the pizza scampi and I had the spaghetti pesto. For about €40 that is most reasonable (+tip and +tip for the accordion player, naturally). We had a very good time at Il Cortile and will most definitely return as we have discovered our favourite Sicilian restaurant in Ghent."
"For the first time i tried the dinner buffet and it was a positive experience. Was there with friends so there was enough choice for starters, appetizers, maindish. Food was delicious, spicy as it should be. Price for the buffet is cheap. Friendly staff as Always."
"This is the best indian food i have ever eaten..have been to the famous curry mile in manchester which has a great reputation for authentic indian food but have to say dosent come close too this place..Its realy a take away with three tables but dont be put off give it a go.ime sure you wont be dissapointed..everything cooked fresh and great value for money..4 adults with starters,mains and a bottle of wine for under 60 euro...complemented cooks and owner and was told they hope to open a restaurant in april in the same street...looking forward to visit asap"
"Great place to eat, have drinks and enjoy the atmosphere. The food is superb, a good variety of beer and mixed drinks. Atmosphere is great.  Highly recommendable."
"nothing better in a cold day than a big bowl of soup! great variety, very tasty and good price!! service was excelent!"
"It's a good restaurant. Probably the best thai restaurant of Ghent. What I can say though is that squid is hard to make. It often gets overcooked which gives you the feeling you are chewing on plastic. But not here, the squid is cooked to perfection. Taking the words of Chris Traeger: ""It literally was the best squid I ever ate.""(this reference will probably be lost on most of you, holla if it doesn't)"
"Myself and 2 customers arrived in Moorsel on business after a horrendous trip,Eurostar was closed so we had to fly to Rotterdam and then train into Belgium,however enough of the moaning I knew Mafioso would still be open.3 handmade pizzas and 12 beers later 3 of them courtesey of the owner we were happy bunnies.Love this restaurant, service with a smile nothing is too much trouble give it a try when you are in the area."
"Great service and a cosy interior.For a modest price you can eat tons of spare ribs (in four different amazing variations).The only two rules are (1) you'll have to make a reservation because the place is usually completed booked, and (2) you've only got two hours to dine, then your table must be available for the next batch. But that's plenty of time to finish a few plates of ribs."
"Great chick, great atmosphere, great beers, great evening with friends :)
A must do in Ghent, best chick in town!"
"Have a quick drink, enjoy a snack, adopt a cat. Simple!

If you don't want to do the whole adoption thing, there are various catty items you can buy, treats for your own puss, or just let the local feline residents entertain you."
"Very pleased with the vegetarian quiche option. Huge portion! Comfortable and pleasant to sit outside, inside is very tastefully decorated. Staff were friendly and service was very quick."
I had the Tout foi Tout and it was so tender and moist. Would definitely recommend going here. Plus the interior is pretty interesting.
"The experience was amazing, food in general is really tasty. We were extremely well served by the waitress Gwendolin, who is very professional and kind."
"While visiting Gent, a friend recommended this place for dinner. Unfortunately I don't remember which burger I ate, but it was soooooo good, I ordered another one. My two friends found the burgers also very delicious. :)"
"Delicious food with kind and fast service for a decent price, located in the center of Ghent! Would definitely recommend it."
"I'm from Glasgow, I eat curry most days and I always have a curry wherever I go. I'm now a little upset that my favourite restaurant is so far away. The food here is stunning. Big, full flavoured dishes, good veggie selection, large portions, really nice pakora and nann, and you're given a choice of how hot you'd like each dish made. Also the best Dal makhani I've ever tasted. The owner is lovely, really welcoming. He even entertained our 7 year old with some magic tricks. If we were staying in Ghent more than 2 days we would have gone more than twice. Really,try this place, you won't be disappointed."
"A very nice and cosy restaurant, in which you can sit inside or outside depending on weather and your preference. The stuff is very friendly and helpful and the courses are delicious too!"
"The atmosphere and the beer here is outstanding. Their selection of beer on tap was great, but their house beer is where it's at! They have a limit of three on some because the ABV is so high, you really get a great bang for your buck! I will never forget this place. So much fun."
"A nice restaurant. I had their Ghent stew, which was quite good. Others at the table had a steak, a roast chicken, and mussels. It all looked good and came in large portions. They also have a few draft beers which is always a plus."
"Popped in on the way back to the hotel for a quick meal. We were pleasantly surprised by the service, atmosphere and most importantly the delicious pasta! A true taste of the Italy - dishes all freshly prepared . Great wine choices to match the pasta- all in all a great time and meal. Lovely to meet the owner and grandson!! Super good thank you x"
"With corona the only possibility to taste some different food is take away so i try the restaurants who give that service and everything little bit helps for the people now. Ordered a maindish, friendly owner and it took around 15 min to prepare. Then i could drive back home and have dinner. Food was delicious like always, i enjoyed every bite of it. Thanks for the service.. Note that this restaurant is only open friday, saturday and sunday for the moment."
This restaurant is tucked away in a small side street and can easily be missed but you should seek it out. The food is quiet exceptional. This restaurant is small so booking is highly recommended if you want o go.A very good genuine welcome. The staff are friendly and helpful. A small menu but exceptionally well cooked and presented. Good value for money. Menus are available in English. Good small wine list.I cannot wait to return to eat here again it is that good. Highly recommended. 
"The real selling point of the White Lion is its terrace at the front which overlooks a beautiful stretch of ancient Flemish houses plus pretty old bridges - a scene unblemished by anything modern - lining the Ghent-Bruges canal. A charming scene both during the day and when lit up at night - and you can enjoy it even in cold weather because of the outside heating system. Very quiet - the whole area is blissfully car-free. When not distracted by the scenery, we enjoyed a generous serving of smoked salmon, a croque monsieur and rump steak, washed down with mulled wine. Good, generous puddings - crème brûlée and waffle with ice cream - and strong coffee served in the Belgian way with a biscuit. Bear in mind that the servings of (very good) chips are enough to feed an army - one serving would have been more than enough for the three of us, rather than the three we ordered. Friendly efficient service. Highly recommended."
A cosy restaurant! The stew beef was amazing & the soup was really nice.. It's open during the day and it's really covenient for a stop during your tour in the center of the Gent!
"I spent four days at a conference in Ghent hosted at and catered by Boon. It was, without doubt, the BEST conference experience I have ever had! The food was delicious -- fresh and flavorful with a wonderful variety. I had a chance to try three different salads, delicious soups, homemade bread, and tasty pasta. And when the owner/chef learned I couldn't eat a particular herb, she whipped up a separate dish for me on the spur of the moment. Their homemade lemonade is also outstanding -- I think I had some at every meal! A MUST VISIT if you travel to Ghent!"
"For the past 3 years I go to Belgium for a festival I always stop in here for a drink. Shout out to Geert who was so nice and offered great service!

I loved the view when sitting outside."
"New place in Ghent. Super good fish quality, perfect rice and very good rice to fish ratio. 

Generous portion, too. Will definitely visit again."
"Amazing!!! This Pub-Restaurant has a real cycling atmosphere, with walls covered by shirts, photos, bicycles and old newspapers, and on the big screens you can follow live the main bike races. It is always full of cyclists recovering after a trip, using the shower-service (2€) of the Centrum.This is a ""must"" for every cyclism-fan!And the food is good as well. Beer too..."
I always try and find somewhere outside the immediate tourist areas as I fear they are a rip off but this place was reasonably priced and the food was amazing. Definitely worth a visit for traditional Flemish food.
"A friend of ours suggested this place and we were bit skeptical about ribs in Belgium. However, the ribs were outstanding. You reserve for a 2 hr block and you can eat asmany ribs as you can. It starts with a full rack and then half racks thereafter. The waiters just keep bringing them. The ribs had a soy based marinade and sauce and were delicious. The potato also was outstanding with an interesting sauce."
"Lovely Irish pub in the heart of Gent. Fantastic team of bartenders. Excellent customer care, tasty food and great beers. Karaoke night every Friday and Guinness the cat big plus: kitchen is open when most restaurants in gent are closed, which allows expats to eat at normal hours "
"I went last summer to Gante for a whole week and I went for lunch to Lucy Chang 5 times. The quality of the food for the price you pay is incredible.
I highly recomend this restaurant."
"Happened upon this restaurant the night before and booked because it was full and we liked the look of the place. Checked out the trip advisor reviews and new we were on to a winner. The staff were great. They explained the ""menu"" by saying 95 % of our customers order the all you can eat ribs, and oh by the way we do other stuff as well. So can 95% of customers be wrong? Of course not the ribs were fabulous, ably complimented by the curry potato and the salad. Ice cream and chocolate sauce to follow rounded of a very enjoyable dining experience. We particularly liked the litre bottle of house wine on the table coming with the instruction of ""drink as much as you like and we charge you for what you have had""Not a fine dining experience but excellent tasty filling food that every one should experience when in Gent."
"We booked beforehand and went for the set menu. We thought it would be a choice, but we got everything! We ordered one dish of the optional extra (we couldn't come all this way and not have it). It was all delicious. It has a lovely atmosphere and was very relaxed. Despite the dishes not being loaded up, the food was lovely but is very rich. We were glad of the walk back to the hotel. A lovely restaurant."
"Huge mixed grill served quickly by friendly accommodating staff. There was everything on that huge, food-strewn platter of barge-like proportions! Very impressed with the food, service and atmosphere."
"I have reserves a table for last night a week in advance via the online booking system ,wrote in A note my partner will celebrate his B-Day ,the staff welcomed us Well , the restaurant was super busy and people that came without reservation were sadly turned away ,food was very well presented we took Cava as aperitif (cool shaped glasses ) then cheese filled dish and salmon fish was really tasty and for main course we got fillet steak with James bond sauce Yummy we revived a plate with happy birthday writing and a small candle and a gift card of 15 euro for next time we come to eat ."
"Great Restaurant !! Arrived at 7 PM Was warmly welcomed , Took the advise of our waiter and ordered the home cocktail ( Gin Based ) Was Super Tasty !! later on ordered the goat cheese dish !! was the best i have had so far and also presented beautifully for a main dish ordered the Angus Steak with Rockford cheese on top was delicious , i guess during our meal our waiter heard that the lady we were with was celebrating her 86th birthday and by herself decided to bring a glass of Cava and a candle , We left the restaurant at around 00:00 5 hours !! never felt pushed to leave and enjoyed every moment will definitely come back again !!"
"Super pizza place, nice place. The chilli my lips is my favourite,  good Italian wine, central and nice surrounding... ."
"We had researched this restaurant through Tripadvisor and then it was recommended to us by the owner of the lovely accommodation we stayed at in Gent. The restaurant focuses on steaks, particularly special breeds. However, we both prefer fillet steak, so had the Aberdeen Angus Fillet which was very tender and delicious. The meal came with great fries/chips and croquettes, a side salad and 3 delicious sauces (Béarnaise, Bordelaise and Peppercorn). Wines are available by the glass and were good. Starters were also excellent, particularly the pata negra ham and cheese croquettes which were amazing!Service was very warm and welcoming and this is a family owned and run restaurant (the brothers are the chef and butcher - perfect for a restaurant!)We returned to the restaurant the next evening and were recognised and received a little extra treat with our meal - a very nice touch.We really enjoyed the food, ambience and welcoming service."
"The burgers are really good (and pretty big) here. I often opt for the veggie options, but I've also tried meat burgers. Here you can find food for everyone's flavor and know that everyone will like it as well."
"This weekend was a superbusy weekend in Ghent, due to Valentines Day. After getting turned away at several restaurants, 't Oud Clooster also did not have a table available but offered us a seat at the bar, which was great. The atmosphere in this restaurant is very nice, dark brown and cosy. Service was excellent, the staff all super friendly and the food was delicious. I'm actually glad we got turned away at those other restaurants!"
"Just a noodle bar, don’t look fancy or anything, but serving most delicious noodles, fresh hand pulled in front of you. Sauces are super tasty, with loads of fresh vegetables. Also very good dim sum."
"Royal India Restaurant serves delicious food with a smile. There are plenty of dishes to choose from, among which many vegan options. Staff is very welcoming and helpful every time we visit. We will definitely visit again."
"Well worth a visit. We just fancied a burger and happened upon Ellis. Great place, burgers made to order. Fries are good too!"
"This used to be the fish market of Ghent - and today it is a classy Restaurant in a large but cozy hall. Service is excellent, choice of meals is surprisingly large for a cuisine as refined as this one. We were a birthday party of five, and almost each of us Chose a different dish - but everyone was excited about the quality of his food. I myself had the waterzooi - just a stew of cod, potatoes, some seafood, and vegetables: Belgian staple Food, but here it was just wonderful."
"Was in Ghent for two weeks on business and ate at this restaurant several times. Food was very good, reasonably priced, and service nice. Definitely would recommend the ""Ghent Stew""; Waterzooi; and other dishes on the menu. Convenient to Ghent Center and walking distance to many attractions and hotels."
"We live in Gent, and everytime we want to spend special moments - just my husband and me, or with dear friends, we go to this restaurant. Everything is fantastic there: the decor- the black room is my favorite- the food - french cuisine- the wines and the service! We went there several times and we were never disappointed. I warmly recommend this restaurant as a fantastic place to spoil yourselves!"
"Had a more than wonderful dinner at La Traverse, but I’m giving a full five stars because for the first time in my life I witnessed a chef storming out of his kitchen to fire a customer!! That’s right - fired - as in ‘ok you’re done here, stop eating, you don’t have to pay (for real), but leave now!’. The customer, young female, apparently had been slinging some disrespectful and racist comments towards the staff for having forgotten to bring her an extra side of fries. A chef who acts by his principles and finds his team more important than his wallet ALWAYS deserves five stars in my book.Some quick foodie review - had vegetarian risotto which was exactly how it should be, and was most definitely not stingy on the veggies. Had ‘Coupe Colonel’ (lemon sorbet with vodka) for dessert which was the BEST I ever had, not too sour, not too sugary, and with confit zest to make it perfect. Not giving the food menu a full five stars because was perhaps missing some creativity or originality, but otherwise highly recommend this restaurant if you’re in the neighborhood. You can’t go wrong here, unless by insulting the staff ;)."
My friend and I enjoyed our lovely meals @ Martino ! The staff immediately made us feel at home ! I enjoyed it and I'm sure were planning on visiting Martino again really soon...
"At publiek people know what aesthetic means. They choose the perfect match between food and plates. Also the plating was perfect. The highlight is the food taste!!! We have been trying different Michelin starred and recommended places recently. Publiek has one of the best quality to offer. And it was impressive for us. Very innovative, creative and full of beauty and unforgettable taste. A must-go in Gent and surrounding region. We will definitely come again flying for hours only for this restaurant!"
"This is definitely the best restaurant in Belgium. The food is just amazing the taste of the food is wonderful everything cook to perfection.My favorite dish, tartar van zalm en groene apel, to good.We are coming back for sure. It's not cheap but it's more than worth it.The service is super and you fell super confortable in there.Thank you for the dinner the best I've had in Belgium. "
"Frankly didn't think I was going to enjoy this restaurant as much as I did, based on the website where it looked ok. Very French-bistro in styling. Very busy early on a Saturday evening (although it was 11th November). Food was excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful."
"I was hesitating to recommend this great little restaurant since too much publicity will just reduce my chance of getting a table in the future...This place does not have a Michelin star (yet) but clearly works on this level (and above). For a very reasonable price you are guided through a surprise menu of 5 courses which are all very taseful, beautifully presented and fully belanced in terms of flavors. No 'a la carte' dining, but that is not needed here. Selected wines are available at somewhat high prices. Staff and kitchen personnel (the latter present the dishes themselves) are most friendly. Interior is very stylish and don't forget to visit the bathroom for a relaxing moment (...)There is also a second dining floor for (smaller) groups."
"We had our wedding party here last month and it was amazing! Great food and chef is very accommodating by making Asian food and it was super tasty!:)Service was great, the guests love it and great table setup. Flexible and fulfil all our request. Highly recommended for wedding venue or even just over here for food.Well done to you all!We cant thank you enough."
Classic Belgian cuisine with a modern twist and focus on taste. Good value. Great atmosphere. Would highly recommend.
"When you ever been in India, and tasted real Indian food you know what it taste like.After my visit to India, I ate at many Indian restaurants in Europe, but it never came close to the real deal. Eating at Royal India restaurant and bar, brought back all the beautiful memories from my visit to Jaipur. The delicious butter chicken and spicy shahi paneer have the exact authentic taste! Beside these delicious dishes, we felt very welcome by the warm hospitality of the owner and staff! Thank you so much for the wonderful evening and the amazing food!We will come back soon and bring our beloved friends and family with us."
"Lovely ambience, few tables , but very nice restaurant. The service was a little slow at times but there was just the one lady serving. She was extremely helpful spoke perfect English and was incredibly polite. The food was very good with reasonable portions . Certainly provided us with a different cuisine capping an enjoyable few days in historic Ghent ."
"Accidentally passed by this resto while checking out Ghent with friends. I have been to several one like this in the US but my friends haven't . They were very intrigued and we made the right decision to book a table about 2 hours advance. We were seated outside, a nice location for being loud and people watching. The salad was good and the tapas were prepared very well. And then came the long sticks of fish, shrimp, chicken, beef, pork, and pineapple! Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked very well. It reminded me really of how good churrascaria is- just like what i had in the US! The food servers were eye candies! Appetizing! And they were really cool and nice. I am so happy to have my last dinner in Ghent before i head to Netherlands!"
"The title says all, great variety of beers, and epic suggestions! Friendly staff and a very impressive building."
"Firstly, a GREAT BIG THANK YOU to the man behind the counter. He explained every single item on the menu to me in English although he said it was going to be hard! Service was friendly and excellent. 6 stars! The food was AMAZING. I was recommended the Syrische Wrap by the nice man and every bite was heavenly. It was chock-full of vegetables, and came with another bowl of salad. Yay!! After all the waffles and chocolates, this is a welcome break. €10.50Ambience was cool, laid back and funky. Was quiet too. Loved it and would have come back a second time if I wasn't leaving tomorrow! :(Lovely and highly recommended. "
"Staff at Midtown Grill is very friendly, helpful and nice! It is them who make dining at this restaurant special! Thank you all! And especially Steffie! "
my friend and i came to this cafe for an aperitivo! we were surprised on how cute is this place and the warmth of the ambience. the crowd is mainly local and they serve very good local beers! no food is served just small tapas and credit card is not accepted just cash! i would suggest to go there if you want to have a real belgian experience 
"The portions here were huge. I ordered the lambrochlette dish for 15€ (2 diff types of salads, chicken drum, a stuffed grape leaf, rice, peas, tons of lamb meat) & comes with a ziplock baggie full of pita bread, which was great bc it served as my “go box”. This dish can easily be shared by TWO people. The service was quick. We would have returned the next day but they are closed on monday"
"We were only in Ghent for 2 nights and it was just after the New Years holiday so they were not open until our last lunchtime meal. Our waiter warned us that they only had the fixed price lunch available, but who cares, it was fantastic. Beautiful restored mansion that the locals definitely know about. Do yourself a favor and skip the tourist traps, just eat here."
We visited this restaurant for lunch with our Belgian relatives and had a really wonderful meal. As is always the case in Belgium the chips and steak were first class! We hadn't seen our relatives for nearly two years so had lots of catching up to do and the restaurant made it all the more special. The staff were lovely and very welcoming. We will definitely eat here again.
"This is was really good experience. Piece of art. Rather cozy and straightforward restaurant with modern menu and functional service. Lunch was planned very good and took into account all smallest needs and restrictions of the customer. Not a cheapest one, but seriously good. It is easy to love this kind of places."
"Our best meal whilst in Belgium! Small intimate restaurant, all inclusive menu if preferred inclusive of wine. Very attentive service to each diner. Absolutely super, would not hesitate to recommend, so glad we chose this restaurant for our only night's stay in Ghent!"
"Had a filet steak....Belgian Blue. Asked for it to be cooked medium, but probably prepared more like medium rare, which was not a problem, as the steak was excellent. Service was very very good, and the meal hit the spot after a long day of travel. We were able to get a table for 3 as a walk-in on a Thursday night. Was a great recommendation by our Ghent Marriott hotel staff. I would definitely recommend and return for another meal. "
"This restaurant is located in the city center of Ghent, easy to reach. The building is really great and shows you a bit of history of Ghent. They have managed to create an environment where you enjoy to stay with your partner, friend or group. Although it can be busy, you will always feel that your group is special. Service is good and the dishes are super. Many choices and not too expensive. Please make reservations."
"Good healthy food in the city center prepared with care and good ingredients. 
A good address for a nice meal"
"Price/Quality... Unbeatable! Great steks, good also for fish. Service is quick and good.
Can be very crowded, bu if they have to refuse, they will give you the appropriate time to return and put a reservation on your table."
"Situated next to Lourdes church and Blessed waters in Belgium, this hotel is wonderful. The service, even when busy is great & the coffee / teas are varied, plus they have the best waffles in Belgium. Various toppings, but the same beautiful, fresh, light and still-warm waffles. I have never tasted them like this before. Fabulous."
"We had a lunch in this restaurant. They have nice terrace above water, day was warm an sunny so it was exactly what we needed. I ordered shark and nice Belgium beer. Portion was very big and food was tasty."
"Fresh food, homemade ayran,smooth service,cheap...the better place to go to in de sleepstraat for turkish food!"
I cannot count how many times I have been eating here with my fiancé but it’s our favorite place. Thai food is one of the best tastes with herbs and ingredients. Love it
"Amazing food! My bf had the luxury burger and said it was the best he's ever had. I had the vegi stew and it was just as amazing.
Good prices, very, very nice staff, quaint, lovely atmosphere.
Would definitely recommend."
"Really tasty juicy burgers. I tried manifesto (egg, cheese and bacon burger) and loved it. I also love the buns with seeds. I'm not a big meat eater but I would definitely go back there again (soon). The place is not big so you should go there early if you want a table for lunch. "
"Out of the scores of restaurants in Ghent we were lucky to find this venue to enjoy a good lunch.
The interior was attractive and comfortable and the service excellent. The food was very well prepared and presented and modestly priced."
"Juicy chicken, great side dishes and good service! I brought my grandma here and even she loved it (she’s hard to please)"
"We had a lovely evening sitting outside Restaurant Otium. We went for the 3 course menu with pasta and it was all delicious. The starter was a shrimp salad with celery, pasta was amazing seafood with a wonderful red sauce, and the desert a divine tiramisu. The restaurant is family-run, personable and service is catered to your wishes. We asked for a slow food evening and stayed for over 2.5 hours. Highly recommended!"
"In a previous review I mentioned that they're a bit too expensive but I retract those words. They've moved to a new location (nearby the old one) and have put their prices up a bit. The new restaurant is an improvement, cosy but classy and much better acoustics. But the important thing is that also the food is even better than before. The chef doesn't overdo stuff, balances every ingredient into a masterpiece of a dish. The staff is professional especially the chef's wife (sommelier and maitre d') whose friendly service is great. The other young waiters were ok. Only the dessert was a bit of a disappointment but purely because of personal taste. Nothing to fault this place really. Expect to pay 100 to 150€ per person but you won't feel cheated!"
"We've askes locals where to go for diner yesterdaynight, they advised us faim fatale.So happy to hear there was just one table left, and when we found the house, i thought this would be the place for a perfect cosy evening. The waiter was very friendly and helped us with the translation of the menucard (ever heard of zwezeriken????). I can't remember what I ate but it was wonderfull!! I knew you could eat good in Belgium, but that it would be that exqui!! wowI've seen a terrace in the back, will it ever be used in this cold wheather?? :-)"
Ate here with a group of friends during a recent trip to Ghent. Food and service was excellent! Would recommend!
Fantastic service and delicious food. Everything was done to make us welcome and ensure we had something nice to eat. Slight language barrier but overcame with help and smiles.
"I go there for the beautiful outdoor seating, and have drinks. But I never tried their food. It's little hidden cafe in the backside of their furniture shop. It's a nice stop for a quite time with your friends. It can get crowded sometimes in summer."
inspiring Asian menu with some European notes (especially for the dessert) in an cozy venue. Good for relaxing and enjoy a nice evening.
"Visited after the classics in a group of 11, very well looked after and amazing quality food. Definitely recommended!!"
Stumbled on this lovely bar with my wife completely unaware it is a gay bar. Enjoyed plenty of cheap beers and spaghetti bolognaise and lasagne bolognaise. Huge portions and very tasty but very good value €9.50 and €11 respsectively. Dont be put off by the gay bar tag as the atmosphere is very romantic eating under candlelight overlooking the river.
"Conveniently located, this restaurant offers authentic taste and great Indian preparations. One of the best Indian food I have had in Europe so far. I must commend the restaurant ambience and their service. It's extremely quick. Owners are polite and very friendly. It was a wonderful experience. Must visit to experience ""home made food"" away from home :)"
"I've had lobster everywhere, my favorite is still the sweet lobster from Maine, USA. However, this place was amazing and different! They serve lobster in so many ways and they make it easy to eat. I was unfortunately so stuffed from a late lunch I couldn't finish my meal, but my friends had no problem finishing for me! I had the lobster with butter and haricot vert, what a nice way to serve it. It's outside the city but has a really neat outside patio area too. Delicious! Wow, and so reasonably priced!"
"I have been already here sometimes. I went for first time togeter woth my girlfriend after reading the comments on Trip Advisor and then we repeated few more times and also went with friends.Service:Friendly, in line with customers with high expectations. They also pay attention to detail and try to make your dinner a full experience.Food quality:Delicious!! Nice meats and fishes.You can also enjoy the meal of the day which usually is a main dish taken from the menu and it's economically a wise decision.Best choices: The T-bone is magnificent! And the Cotê a bos (or something similar)Stofvless is my favorite Belgian dish, which is well serve in here, but perhaps not the top one of my list.Among the fishes; salmon is the right choice.Price:Its a brasserie with average prices, bot cheap, not too expensive.Reasonable taking into consideration Belgium prices.One of the best places to go in Ghent."
"The main attraction of this restaraunt is its interior. Being a mix of an antiques shop an a victorian baronette living room the intyerior overwelmes a visitor with lots of artifacts located along the walls, making the whole atmoshere of the place to fill enchanted.The food and service are also of the highest level.The prices are acordingly high, but not too high for a middle class person. "
"Nice location: you can sit outside in the garden or inside. Delicious food: a nice selection of Belgian classics, meat and vege dishes for reasonable prices (not student prices but not expensive, about 15€-25€ for main dish). For each dish, there is a proposal of matching beer/wine in the menu. They also use different symbols depending on gluten, vege, vegan... so every dietary need is taken into accountThe service was great. It started to rain, so we had to move to a table inside, but this went very smooth."
"Pizza how it should be. Nice Italian restaurant. Pizzas were superb and huge. Draught beer was poor though considering what you can get in the bars around Ghent. 
Service was good and it's well priced."
"Excellent burgers, frittes, and local Gruut Bruin along the way from the St Pietr station to Gent Markt. The burger was fresh, thick, perfectly cooked to medium and juicy. Burgers are a new item on Europe's food scene but Midpoint makes a good one. The Gruut Bruin was a great local brew, rich and malty without being overwhelming.A nice combination for a day in beautiful Gent!"
Varied menu with just the right range of drinks and menu items to hit the spot for a quick bite. Great service.
"Very good place ! I've been there with my wife and children (13, 17, 18) and we enjoyed a lot. 
The restaurant is next to the b and b hotel and in downtown center."
"Very good food, very nice service, very casual place. No chi-chi, superb food in a very casual atmosphere. We've been there already several times, for dinner and for lunch."
"We were there to take a breakfast, that was incredible, I took Ayurvedic kitcharee and te chai. Minnesota daughter asked the avocado toast and tofu bowl and my friend took the Greek cheese with caramel and apple. Every ingredient is really fresh , the taste is amazing. I recommend that 100%. "
"It's the perfect place to stay to chill out during the night. Huge variety of beers, the majority being Belgian, which is a plus"
"We went there allready a few times and they never disappoint. Pizza's are crunchy like they should be, the meat is tender and the pasta's are amazing. Very friendly staff. Absolute must for Italian-lovers in Ghent!"
Went recently for a haircut. The hairdresser is very friendly. The salon upstairs is cosy and a nice change in scenery compared to other salons. The cafe downstairs is also very cosy and they offer some great coffee.
Very nice restaurant with very nice people who guide their guest very well. If u are noy familiar with spicey food they explain u very well that u can chose 1 2 3 level :) very very delicious!!! Thx also very beautiful restaurant!!!
"This is my favourite restaurant in Ghent and its far surroundings. I have been eating here at least once a month for the past 5 years. Lovely service by the lady of the house, loungy atmosphere and always superb and unique Asian influenced food. Outstanding and fairly priced winelist as well. I can't think of any better non-Michelinstar rated place to eat and enjoy."
We were here last week and we were impressed by the service and the nice food. Staff was friendly with us and the atmosphere was incredible. We enjoyed our trip to this country and this restaurant was part of it.
"Because the city controls remodeling efforts the place looks unfinished and people think it is not open. It is an elegant atmosphere, excellent food and outstanding staff. Very accommodating since I wanted only one course and not five course. Maybe they are used to serving tourists in a hurry but we asked to be served in a leisurely manner and that is what we got."
"Top notch burgers, they don't have a massive selection but they make up for that in the quality of what they do. We had the potato wedges which were delicious. Great cocktails too, their cosmopolitan is delicious. Recommended."
"The unique restaurant, unique services and carefully selected dishes. Inevitably!
You feel like you're in your home, but treated and served like a king!"
"I’ve been back to Otium after a wonderful first dinner.
Needless to say, the second time back has been nothing but marvelous, the food is of great quality, the service is really professional, and the ambiance feels awesomely nice.
Highly recommend!"
"An address with a unique character, the art deco interior is filled with everything Chanel. Freddy, the owner and host, made us feel very welcomed, explained the restaurant and cuisine, and advised us based upon our tastes. The house specialty is lobster. We had three different preparations between the four of us. It was all fantastic, delicious and a nice holiday treat. "
"We spent two nights at the Pakhuis and enjoyed it very much. Staff were very helpful and smiling (which you do not always come across in Belgium). Food was excellent, wines just the same. Reasonably priced. Must book: very popular."
"A nice place, the ideal location for a sunny day, when you can enjoy a cold drink or ice cream on the terrace,with a great view of Schelde."
"The best place for a cosy night out in Berlare. Good food & drinks, interesting people, great interior"
"Even with the wonderful food (and better beer) in Belgium, sometimes a yankee just wants a good old fashioned hamburger and microbrew. Uncle Babe's really hit the spot. I lovingly eyed the bar, and imagined being a regular. Lovely staff and delicious food. Definitely go for the onion rings!"
Very good food and service good for family party they have a small private room good for 10-15 persons
"Never ate here but the coffee is amazing. The host, a Serbian man with the body of a bear welcomes you with the best of Balkan hospitality.The setting is an antique shop.It might seem a bit chaotic but that adds value to the atmosphere.Great place!"
"Excellent restaurant in the market place.
The steaks are exceptional the beer is good as is the wine.
Cannot fault this place."
"As a Chinese, it is hard to find a ""Chinese"" restaurant here in Belgium. To be honest, most of the Chinese restaurant here is trying to fit the ""sweet taste"" preference of local people. If you want to taste real Chinese dish, Seli's is the best choice. One thing you may not believe is that the restaurant was introduced to me by a volunteer who works in the animal adoption centre in CITY PARK. The nice lady was in Shanghai for 5 years, and she told me there is a nice noodle bar in Gent. See? It is not only Chinese opinion. After been Seli's once, I regularly go there when I want to eat noodles, especially when it is winter time, you can enjoy a bowl of warm soup.... Anyway, I like Seli's. Strongly recommended! "
"Really nice seating, excellent service, and the food was amazing. The best cod I had in my life.
We were a bit in a hurry and they tried to accommodate this even if the restaurant was full. We really appreciated it."
"A bit of a wait for the food to turn up, but more than worth it! Simple, but very refined dishes, accompanied by really good drinks. Excellent servive, and a great view on historical Ghent. Absolutely recommended!"
An unpretentious restaurant with probably the best frites in Ghent. The frites with the tartaar sauce is delicious and definitely recommended. Great prices as well.
"When you want a good lunch or diner at a good price this is one of the best addresses. It is also a nice interior and the personnel is very kindly. The best is to take a menu. When the weather is good there is also a great garden with a agreeable terrasse. There is always mutch people, so it is not a the best address when you want a intimate place although normal it is not a great problem. Réservation is always the best."
Food was simply delicious with gorgeous flavours.  They were really kind about me being gluten free so I didn't feel as though I was missing out.  Would really recommend.  Great waitress!
"We had spent the afternoon wandering around Ghent, browsing and buying a few bits, so we wanted to sit down and relax. My fiancee wanted to sit by the river, so we spotted this place and sat outside. It was cold, dry but sunny. We ordered 2 Kasteel Donkers and chatted about our day. The staff were superb, and even though the seating was beside the river the drinks were the best prices we had all weekend. My fiancee was getting cold so they gave her a blanket to wrap over her coat. Eventually we were getting hungry so went inside to eat. We sat near the door, but a nice waiter said 'no come further inside, its warmer'. They lit a real fire while we were there too. We ordered some fizzy lemonade, red wine and a Grappa. My fiancee had smoked salmon tagliatelli & I had a croque monsieur. Afterwards we shared a hot cherry waffle with ice cream. The restaurant has many unusual artefacts to look at as well. We felt very welcome, the service was second to none, and the food was great. Why can't all restaurants be so accomodating? I would recommend this place to anybody."
"Located right in the main square, this place serves great coffee and some good breakfast options. 
Absolutely lovely staff!"
"I just loved this place to bits.. it starts with the fact that you enter it through a wide alley, lit with two huge medieval candles, and then you climb up a little staircase and enter one of the cosiest places in town. A bit dark, candle lit, warm (don't wear a big sweater, you'll be so hot) and cheerful people. Food is amazing. Loved the service as well. Friendly, helpful and not pushy. "
"Took an impulsive day trip to Ghent from Leuven. Got off the train around 1 PM and made our way to City Center. Happened upon Pakhuis. My sons fiance met us there. Easily the best meal we had in Belgium which is saying alot. I had rabbit and my wife had salmon. Food, wine ( I know not beer) service and ambience were perfect. A cold winter afternoon. And then the Ghent city center. Art architecture and no crowds cold but worth it. November in Belgium. Loved it."
"I loved this place! The noodles are amazing and very well served! 
Loved! It.s even possible to see they making the noodles! Very fresh food."
"The menu is short, but the concentration on seven or eight dishes makes this so special: you basically try und share everything. The food quality is outstanding, with attention to detail, texture and fine taste. It‘ fusion food, with links to all continents, but without being extremely exotic and overly complicated.The restaurant is nicely decorated, and the atmosphere is relaxed. Itˋs also great to see the chef prepare the food in the open kitchen. We had an excellent evening, and this is highly recommended."
"After searching Gent for traditional Belgian dishes (in particular, Waterzooi) I found this little gem. They don't have 200 beers but a good selection of beers wines and other drinks and a nice food menu. The menu and wait staff are trilingual. The food and service were both very good and reasonably priced. Gent seems full of Italian restaurants but this place has a good variety. "
"The food was awesomely prepared we did call for a reservation, although it wasn't packed, the noise was not bad but maybe because it wasn't full. I had read it was a Brewery so I wasn't expecting a romantic dinner but the quality and finish was excellent. The fixed menu was a very good value."
The food is absolutely delicious. Traditional Indian Food. The real deal. And the staff is super friendly and generous. Love it every time i visit.
"Best indian food in Gent, and very nice and friendly service. Came here several times, and the food was always very good!"
Not much to say. We walked in. The hostess could not have been more accommodating. We spoke no flemish but she helped us navigate the menu. Food was terrific. Very good value too. I'd go back for sure.
"Excellent sushi restaurant, the food and service is always top notch. Highly recommended for sushi lovers (and beginners)."
not the first and certainly not the last time I will order here. The food is really tasty; they also have great vegetarian dishes.
We had dinner with the entire family. The food was great and the wine pairing was perfect. By far the best culinairy experience of my life
"We've been here countless times. This is a fantastic night restaurant. The steak is fantastic, but so it the fish, all grilled just in front of you. The house wine is very good. This is a small restaurant, and the owner does everything on her own. If the place is full, you'll need to wait a bit, so be prepared for that. Sometimes, local artists come play some music. When the owner's got some time, and you're ok with it, she comes to sit with you and have a chat. It's a very cosy place, and we've always had a good time here. Open until 2 am!"
"good food at a really reasonable price in Ghent center. Staff is friendly and easily speak English. Food is cooked on order from an open kitchen, fresh with really good taste.
Reccomended"
"I fall in love with this place. of course , it was first time for us to visit here but it's simply wonderful. The Staffs were kindly and gently. The atmosphere was exactly like a museum of fashion and the iconic women who defined it. We had a coffee and tea and delicious homemade dessert. Mellow flavor is smooth. I would highly recommend this place! "
"If you want a quick and healty bite, go in! It's a warm and friendlly atmosphere and you get true value for your money"
"We organized a 35 person fixed dinner at Volta. Everything was wonderful. But in particular, the created a large number of unique dishes for our 6 vegans that were truly delicious. Very well executed!"
Great sandwiches at reasonable prices and never a long wait. The owner works very fast and is very helpful and friendly.
"We had a great meal here. The menu offered many tempting choices. The service was excellent and the price very reasonable. The location gives a fabulous view of the canal - great for people watching. With so many restaurants, it is hard to decide where to eat. This is an excellent choice."
"It became one of my favourite bars in the city,the music its always great(oks school pop,rock,classics)the beer selection is great with plenty of choices and the staff is always very friendly, there is a pool table and the locals are friendly,some nights the play live music and the location is very central.I feel there like home"
"This was one of those truly unexpected places that stands out in a side alley amongst the splendid backdrop of one of the most beautiful places in Europe. Who expects amazing, fresh, killer Thai food in the middle of Ghent?!? Well, Travel Friends, when you grow weary of the typical Belgian fare (waffles and beer), this is THE place to go. We had the most authentic, delicious, amazing Thai food I have had in Europe, without question. The owner & manager offered amazing recommendations that helped us really get the food we were craving, and whoever is behind that kitchen door is a Thai master in mixing LEGIT Thai flavors for the optimal flavor bomb. I don’t even know what to recommend as everything we ate (even down to the fish sauce) was fantastic! Highest recommendations! Please give this fabulous, real, and amazing restaurant a try, your taste buds will thank you! AND, ask for extra chilis, they really deliver. "
"We took our Belgian relatives to the traditional restaurant as a thank you treat. It was quite busy considering it was a Tuesday night. The service was good and I really enjoyed the food. We all shared a Scampi starter, then I had the Gentse Stoverij, which is a beef stew. It was delicious, and there was so much of it I took a doggy bag home to have the next day. I really enjoyed the food there and would recommend a visit as they do a range of traditional Gent dishes."
"What a great place just outside town! We loved the atmosphere, music and people. They have a quirky mix of mexican and middle-easter dishes, which works out fine. The pulpo and the lamb were perfect. The wines are good too. Tip: I think the reds should be served around 16 degrees, room temperature was too hot. They also have a club in the basement, how cool! The neighborhood is very nice too, we had a lovely stroll back into town. Amigo is just fine. "
"Visited this place with my brother, who lives in Ghent, and I felt like a local. The atmosphere is very much like an authentic pub and the food was amazing. Definitely planning to go back the next time I am in Belgium."
"Very friendly staff, there to answer any questions… Nice trendy atmosphere. The food is amazing. I had the kebab wrap with sweet potato fries on the side and they brought a little sauce for the salad/kebab and it was all DELICIOUS! Next time I'm in Ghent I'm definitely visiting again!"
"Great location - right in the city centre
Modern looks and seets
Perfect staff, super friendly and kind 
Great food .. really really superb
And great value for money.

Best place in Ghent"
"My partner and I visited this place late June. We sat outside and the view was beautiful! We ate carpaccio and garlic snails for starters, beef and beer stew (heavenly) and chicken Casserole for mains. These were typical Belgian foods... I had a whole pot of stew with a side of chips (frites) and struggled to get through it... Very filling and delicious. "
"What a wonderful experience we had with our lunch at this Beutiful restaurant.After a day spent wandering around, proberly one of the most fairy tail and best kept cites in Europe, we looked at lots of places to sit and have a romantic lunch, some are two commercialised, some too run of the mill, and some far to pretentious for shorts and polo shirt, we finaliy Came to the Allegro Moderato.It sits on the bank of the canal, with lovely views of the city and the activity of the boats on the water, if your a people watcher, this is the place for you, and it has the option of sitting in the sun or shade.We opted for the lunchtime set menu, which gives you 3 different types of starter, main and dessert.... It was a difficult choice what to have, they are all wonderful.The staff are extremely efficient, friendly and knowledgeable, and you have no long wait for the food, unlike many restaurants in Europe.We spent two hours here, mostly people watching, and taking in the ambience and sights, the old parliament building oppersite is based on our westminster palace, including Big Ben.We would recommend this establishment to any seasoned traveller, who knows how bad it can be in Europe to find excellent food, at a sensible price.Ghent is a must see city, so much history, and so well preseved, take the boat hire from the side of the restaurant, it's only €7 and well worth seeing the city from the water, and with a running commentary of what your looking at, with humour thrown in about the history."
"I love to try restaurants and write honest reviews about my personal experience but this restaurant is a very difficult one. Who am i to judge this high level of dishes and everything that goes with it. I think a star from Michelin already says all but gonna write how i felt about all this. When i made the reservation i had contact with the restaurant because im not allowed to eat certain things. From the first email i felt comfortable that they would try to give me the same experience as my friend. Once you come in you feel welcome, staff is soo friendly, attentive. And important, trough the menu they explained what they changed for me in the dish. The restaurant isnt big but still theres enough distance between the tables to feel relaxed. Once seated and drinks are served.. the experience starts. We took the 7 course menu so we could enjoy the whole picture. Every dish from the small bites, extra dish and all the other courses that follow.. one big wow and soo many flavours and tastes in every dish. With every dish you could get a different wine which were all perfect and the explanation of what kind of wine and the area was clear and understandable. Some of the dishes were presented at the table by the chefs with their passion. Waitingtimes between the dishes were perfect. We could reserve a parking space right behind the restaurant which was very easy. A big thank you for this lovely experience to the chef and the staff."
"Lotus Root is a relatively small and unassuming restaurant, and a huge surprise in this little town. We dined there on a Sunday evening, and were the only table that evening. Although this can be an odd experience in certain restaurants, it wasn't here - instead, we received the most incredible wine and food journey from Caroline Buensalido, one of the owners, and thus unforgettable service! The wine list is fascinating, with a wide array of Californian wines. Caroline is an expert - knowledgeable but playful. We learnt a good deal in this one evening, and tasted some outstanding wines, perfectly paired with our dishes. We chose a 4 course menu (menus change seasonally), which ultimately was interspersed with tantalizing mini dishes and palate refreshers. Literally each course was a delight for the senses, but even the so-called simplest side dishes, like a purée of potato with lemon zest, were memorable.It certainly made no difference to the Lotus Root team that they were only serving two people that evening - we still received 100% perfection in food, wine and service. In fact, I consider that we may have received more...!If you love extraordinary food and wine, and thorough, caring service, then I highly recommend that you reserve a table at Lotus Root now!"
"Been here twice. Try the orange duck! Best ever. Despite that the place is often empty, the food is delicious!"
"Everything that entered my belly was wooooow....good site n good people. Friendly to clients, polite speech and lovely atmosphere."
We were travelling by boat and moored up at this restaurant for one night. It was so good we stayed for two! Despite Covid-19 the tables were set up (safely) outside overlooking the river. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful to two Brits who speak little Flemish. There is a good choice of beers. The ribs were very meaty and delicious; the mussels superb.
"Great pizza! Autenthenic, fresh, so yummy! Really quick and easy to pay with a large group- were accomdating and brought us extra chairs- couldn’t recommend more!"
"Totally reliable, friendly atmosphere, great service....cannot do better in Gent..."
Wonderful meal...delicious and creative.  Darling waitress and waiter.  Helpful with menu choices.  Worth a visit!
"the food is great, no discussion but there is a feeling you get like you're invited to join the family table. The service, the food, the setting, it just all adds up. Amazing place"
"Super tasty, lots of people during lunch time. There are lots of options including veggie menus. During the lunchtime, hords of people ordering beautiful burgers, therefore you need to be early to get a chance."
"An authentic Greek restaurant. Friendly service. 
Set lunch with starter, main plate and dessert for 10,80€, it's a hidden gem!
Flavors are pure. Portions are big enough."
"The place is well located. In front of a tram stop. The interior is nice, a bit dark. They offer different kind of ramen soup. Tonkatsu or miso, etc. Since I'm not so much into miso, I enjoyed the tonkatsu broth. The price is good. The portion is perfect for me. I ordered the special ramen. It came with a lot of toppings. "
"We dined at Maison-D on the 30th of December, with a group of 15 people. We had the 3 course menu with aperitif and selected wines. All dishes were works of art, visually and in taste. Service was excellent. Level of a 'star' restaurant, but affordable."
"The Decor is amazing really, good quality ribs, as many as you want. I would have preferred a sauce but they tasted amazing anyway. Helpful staff and no rush put on you."
"We were in search of a place for lunch in Gent, but most of those with good reviews were closed on Sunday. It was not looking good for a Sunday lunch in Gent. Until...We found this one, not by chance. We were greeted by friendly waiters who found us a table, despite lack of reservation (it’s recommended that one has a reservation, but we tried our luck).The restaurant is in what seems to be an old house and it’s guests are kept spaced out. We were given a table close to the front. The food was wonderful; the beef could not have been better, and the accompaniments were a fine addition. One is given a selection of three sauces and some vegetables and side salad. "
"Last week at Royal India we had a very warm welcome! It really felt like coming home after such a long time of not being able to visit our favorite (btw, we have only one) Indian resto and to enjoy the delicious meals that are served. Really happy to be back again! We really did appreciate the welcome and the kindness. The food was again (yes: again!!), I should say 'as usual' delicious! There is only one Indian resto that has that 'all in' feature! One should definitely visit the place to get acquainted with the warm welcome, the hospitality and the delicious meals!We'll be back soon!! ;-)"
"if you like Rib's you'll love Amadeus, Eat as mush as you like, the rib'sjust keep coming, it not posh, but its goy good atmospheree a night not to be missed on your visit to Ghent"
"Really nice, cosy but modern fondue restaurant in the centre of Ghent. Really good 'all in' menu offer for a really good price, around 40 euros. Stone grill options as well as fondue. Fast service, friendly and very clean interior/toilets.Not too smelly or hot, which some fondue restaurants can be! Very fresh salads, GREAT fries and lots of sauces! Have been back time and time again and never lets me down! If you like fondue then you'll like it here for sure!"
"Authentic place, with a superb service en even better meals.
Fresh products only, and a chef how knows to bring the best of it !!!
Absolute a visit worth, don't forget to reserve in the weekends..."
"I went there with my wife. Food is fantastic, very tasty and spicy. Price is very reasonable. There is 10% discount for student. 
The owner is very warm and friendly. Absolutely will go there again!"
"Have been to du progress on more than one occassion and have sampled a variety of there dishes, i have had the fillet steak, filleted t. Bone and chateau brand all of which have been of the finest quality. The wine is also very resonable. For a starter cheese croquettes, main steak and wine and coffee it was roughly 30 euro per person and well worth the money. All the staff are very pleasent and polite. A reservation is a must. Top tip: try the roquefort cheese sauce"
"Whether it is for breakfast, coffee and pie, or a wine in the evening, this place can give it all with a lot of passion and in a fantastic setting. (The wine cellar is one of kind!)"
"Just had a great break in Ghent and the icing on the cake was a final meal at De Rave restaurant. The small restaurant is just off the tourist trail. You can find it just behind the Belfort Hotel (turn right out of the Belfort Hotel, and right again down a narrow street called Schepenhuisstraat2). It's at the bottom of this street on the corner. The menu is in flemish but the waiter/owner speaks excellent english and is attentive and helpful. It's not cheap but the food is to die for. I would recommend the menu + supplement at 58 euros: a wonderful aperitif, white wine with the fish and red with the meat and coffee afterwards."
"We loved this place, great ribs and great service.The building work going on outside was a bit confusing,but we found the entrance.The decor is magnificent ,and worth a visit.
Would definitely return :-)"
"Hand made noodles are a treat. And yes, I find they are different in taste and texture than prepared dried noodles, but that is the treat. Thanks Selina & Nic."
Such a fabulous find.  We stumbled on this place on our last night in Ghent.   Surrounded by all the tourist restaurants whose menus are the same.  Fabulous wine and cheese and snacks.  Highly recommend
"There is really not a lot to add to the other reviews!We visit Gent every year and we always look forward to eating at ""The Cloverleaf"". This year we dined twice and both meals were excellent. The service from both the owner and her student assistant added to the enjoyment of the food.I suffer from Coeliac disease but there was no problem only one of the dishes on the fixed menu could not be made gluten-free.Be warned - it is a small restaurant and is often fully booked. Therefore try and reserve a table."
"This place was buzzing with high footfall every time we walked past. We went twice for a really tasty soup with topping of cheese,meatball, parsley and onion salad mix if you want with rolls and an apple. All for 5euro. Choices included pumpkin, califlower, asparagus, tomatoe, spinach and broccoli. "
I’ve been to Royal India twice now and it has been amazing both times. I will be going back again tomorrow. It is definitely the best Indian food I’ve ever had and I have had a lot! Check this place out. Nice staff too.
"Great service, clean, nice terrace. I had the signature ramen which was awesome. We also shared a fried pork bun and it tasted great. 

Keep up the good work!"
"This place is amazing! Service, food and atmosphere was fantastic. I warmly advise to visit this restaurant!"
"I don't like to spend fortunes on basic food.  This place is fantastic. 12 euros for the dish of the day. 29 euros for the more culinary dish of the month.  Many locals inside, if that's not a good sign?"
"We have been here before but didn't have such a welcome as we did this time. The hospitality was second to none. There is a good choice of beers especially celtic cider, amongst others. We did not have a meal here but were given free chips thanks. The staff are great Steve and Dom to name just 2.We made so many new friends here too. Free wi-fi helps too. We will definitely come here again."
"Café Otis is a cozy bar near the old city center of Ghent.They have a varied menu with different Belgian beers, non alcoholic drinks and qualitative short drinks. For those who like there are delicious cocktails invented by the bartenders themselves.It's a cozy place with good music, an old-school retro interior and a terrace that's available for the whole year, heated during the winter. The bartenders are very friendly and able to give you more information about the drinks they serve. It's always possible to order something that's not on the menu, perhaps they have...One of the bars to spend your time when you are visiting Ghent!"
"It's basically soup, open sandwiches and a side but no matter what you pick it will be delicious. I had the prawn open sandwich with veg soup and beetroot side. Very reasonable prices as well and a lovely atmosphere. The cafe is beautiful as well, very hygge. Staff very friendly."
"Dinner, very good steak! Nice ambiance. Packed during a week evening. Suitable for couples & special occasions."
Refreshingly original delicious pizzas in a cosy setting with fabulous friendly staff and service. Rarely have we enjoyed such venue but strongly recommend and certainly memorable food and range of excellent beers
"I have eaten in most of Europe's Chinatowns and this is real food. They advertise themselves as non European and they are right. After three trips to China all I can say is that this is the real deal.

Amex welcome !!!"
"We really enjoyed being in the old style room. The decor helps give a lovely dining experience. We both had the all you can eat ribs, which were super tasty and good value. We managed an extra set of ribs but could only manage one of the delicious jacket potatoes, which come with spiced butter. The waiting staff were extremely helpful and professional. Make sure you book ahead as this place is nearly always rammed - and not just with tourists - locals were tucking in when we were there. "
"An absolutely astounding array of beers are available, with a totally unique vantage point on the deck of an old barge! Not the cheapest bar in Gent, but worth visiting for the experience"
"Look, this is not a michelin star restaurant, and thus i do not think that people should expect it to be. If however, you are looking for great food at great prices (with a lot of food on a plate (as much as they can fit on one to be honest)), this is the place. They have lots of stuff to entertain young children, in the summer there is a playground. I love the authenticity of the place, the waiters are typically very friendly, ... Also, the kitchen is open throughout the day which doesnt happen a lot in BE."
"What a surprise with randomly visit . Been traveling around the US then Belgium and came to Gent the 1st time. Walking passed by and tried to walk in. Ordered some my favorite dishes . I was surprise how good it was. Then I come here every time when I come and visit Gent. Visited 10 times in 2 months . I love good food , what else ! :)))"
"I found this restaurant through The HappyCow app and was NOT disappointed. The restaurant was small but clean and the owner was readily available to answer questions. We both had the home made ""mozzarella"" sandwich with pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula- delicious. After a brief conversation with the staff members I picked up a ""Snickers"" which was a delight. Even my friend who is not vegan thought everything was excellent and wouldn't not have known that she wasn't eating traditional mozzarella. Well done Mie!"
"Down to earth restaurant with tons of great food options for people with all kind of dietary restrictions. Got two waffles, and they were both fantastic. Service wasn't the fastest in the world, but the servers were super helpful and we didn't have an issue with their relaxed pace, and the food came out rather quickly."
"It is 2 years since last visiting Ghent and I couldn't wait to book a meal at the Amadeus II. Wonderfull atmosphere and music and the food to die for! I always have the giant prawns as I'm not a meat eater but the other 3 people with me had the ribs. The staff were very pleasant as usual and attentive without being intrusive, service was quick. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Thank you Amadeus!"
"I am a keen Sushi fan, I have eating these dishes all over the world. I have eaten it in Japan , Hong Kong, New York, LA, France , Jakarta, Belgium etc. But this one is the best I had outside Japan and Hong Kong."
One of the best Italian food I’ve eaten outside of Italy! Great service and the price fits very well for the quality of food. They try to use seasonal vegetables so the menu changes very couple of months. Definitely a place to explore!
"We did not book, but the waiter let us have dinner at the bar. We could see more action in the kitchen like this.The restaurant is in a very old but nice building lived before by nuns. After that it was a sweet factory and a bar.The athmosphere is chuch like, but the waiters quite hipsters.The food thought is unbelievable!Must try: pork with sauce cheese!We did not have more space in our bellies after the luxurious burger, but definitely next time."
"This is my second review of this place because it's so ridiculously good. Go, get noodle soup, and use the hot peppers as well. I lived in China for years and these are the only noodles I've had outside of China that are as good. Chewy, tasty, plentiful, with authentic veggies - drinkable broth (even the vegetarian broth is miles better than most chicken or pork based broths you'll find elsewhere)... and the hot pepper mix is the best I've ever had - even in China. Go there, go there, go there."
I went in alone for a burger and it was very tasty. Staff was very friendly and everything was coronaproof. I will definitely come back again.
"I have been there several times, always great experience. The service is good and the food is delicious!"
"We just returned from a visit to Ooidonk Castle and had the great fortune to drop into Passe-Vite for lunch. We couldn't have been more delighted with the warm welcome we received. The host/owner showed us to a table in a very cozy main dining room. He spoke impeccable English and guided us through the menu. Each of us ordered off the list of daily specials. One of us had a variation of Carbonnades, the Flemish stew, made with pork instead of beef. The other had the grilled salmon with a cold penne salad. Both main dishes were outstanding, very flavorful and very generous portions. The wine by the glass, a red and white were both delicious as well. For dessert, our host suggested that we take coffee on the large and comfortable terrace in the back of the restaurant. In addition to coffee, we shared a tasty creme brûlée, caramelized table side. Living in Brussels, we are not used to warm and attentive service. The husband and wife who run Passe-Vite not only know how to offer delicious food courtesy of a talented chef, but they also know how to greet and treat customers as true guests. We miss that in Brussels but now know that we can get our fix of hospitality and great food a short drive away in Deinze. If you are in the vicinity of Ghent, try to stop by Passe-Vite, you won't be disappointed."
"Went here for lunch last week. It was raining and not warm but sat outside under cover and outside heaters. Had a fantastic starter and main for 13 Euro each. Great choice for this price. Wife had really nice tomato and mozzarella salad. I had pitta pork. Both very good. My main was essentially an excellent fish pie and my wife had steak with pepper sauce, fries and salad (no supplement). Both were very good (and my wife is very particular about her steaks). We were given excellent free bread rolls and an amuse bouche. Spent a week in Bruges and area and this was the best value meal we had all week. Service was also great. Don't know about evening menus but if this is the quality then it will be good."
"We ordered the catering take out menu and it was great. Well prepared, packed and the organisation was professional and lean. Well done and thanks for making our year end more festive !"
"We are spending a weekend with friends in Aalst and they had booked a table for lunch. We followed their advice and took the set menu with the wine pairings.The whole experience was exquisite.. the service was top notch, the dishes beautifully cooked and presented and the wine pairings sublime.Hopefully we will be back! "
Just back from having a great dinner. We didn't go for the set menu and choose a la carte. Beef carpaccio was outstanding followed with grilled deer veal fillet which was perfect. My wife had shrimp croquettes which were rich and tasty while my daughter had pumpkin soup. They both had fillet steak with pepper sauce. As dessert our daughter had a gorgeous chocolate fondue and my wife and had sabayon with wire wine and Grand Marnier. Wonderful food in a cosy comfortable setting.
"While visiting Gent for Xmas, we as group of 6 friends came across this restaurant for lunch. The quality of food in the buffet menu was amazing. Freshness in the taste of meat and the spices used to cook lamb was a treat us. We were happy to choose this place for lunch. Best wishes to maintain this standards you have set.Will visit again on out next trip to Gent."
"This was our second visit. We where happy a friend could not go and as the reservation are so hard to get and they know we love the place, we where happy to take over their place. Again, we where over the moon with the meal. Everything is so delicate and refined , their are so many subtil tastes and textures , truly delicious. When you walk out you have a feeling of satisfaction on every level . A must go."
We came across t’Klokhuys walking around town last December. It was excellent then and it was just as good this evening. The Flemish Stew and Steaks were particularly good. Great attentive friendly service. It is advisable to book as this is clearly popular with locals. Highly recommended and see you again in May!
"We had a lovely dinner with very good white and red house wine. The young lady's who served us, were super friendly and good at what they did. We enjoyed it very much."
"Operated by a husband and wife team, the husband is the chef and has earned his Michelin star, and easy enough to figure why. Our dinner was outstanding in every way, and service extremely friendly and helpful. We were without a car, with our accommodation 2km away. The chef offered to drive us back and we gratefully accepted. Super place, look forward to a return."
"One of the best meals I've had anywhere. The meal began with a selection of breads and interesting butters, moving on to dainty little appetisers including meringue with iced beetroot. We only ordered a main course, and when the turbot arrived, we weren't disappointed. Unable to resist a pudding, I had a confection of blueberries, chocolate, tuilles, shards of white chocolate and ice cream, blueberry paste, etc The meal ended with coffee and dishes of chocolates, madeleines, and casudons (local delicacy). This all cost less than £40 each! Beautiful restaurant, looking out over the canal and all the ancient lit up waterside buildings. May go back to Ghent just to go there again."
"Lovely little bar, always busy inside but there is outside seating and heaters! So even when it was cold we could drink here, they even provide blankets! Lovely drink named roomer that a thoroughly enjoyed here. If you can find a seat upstairs it’s lovely up there. Would definitely recommend."
"Bazalia deserves also a star , just like his great brother downside! Great service . I like Roberto ."
"Lovely ambiance, great food, friendly staff, a gem.
€16 will get you the unlimited ribs deal which is great"
"If you are looking for a quality restaurant in Aalst with a friendly owner serving you, look no further. In the summer time definitely go for the traditional mussels. 
PS: English menu's are available."
"Originally, we started in Amadeus. It was verz bad experience for me. The waiter seated us and nothing happened there. I had a feeling that they do not like foreigners. After ten minutes, a waiter came up to us. We have applied for a menu in English. He gave us the menu in Flemish. Furthermore, nobody talked with us. We have waited long enough. All people around eat but nobody talked with us. After twenty minutes, we went to restaurant De Gekroonde Hoofden. It is very close. Everything was great there. It is super resturant with excelent service and eat."
"Four euros for lunch or supper til seven pm. Even open Monday and Sunday. Today's choices were tomato, chervil, and he winner mushroom. Plus two small rolls and a lovely apple. Soft drinks available. Tables in and out."
"Very friendly staff, very fast service and very delicious food!We arrived late and very hungry with 2 children. We felt welcome and comfortable immediately. The service was relaxed and attentive. We ordered a wide variety of meals and they were all perfect.I have never written a restaurant review before, but these folks deserve it!"
"Great meal, correct price setting, great atmosphere and decorated interior! But what i loved the most was the fact that the staff was so enthousiastic about their work. You can see that everybody loves to work there AND knows their job!! Would recommend this one when in Ghent!"
"A group of about 30 people, an announced dinner to this restaurent. We could choose between 2 -3 options for starters, main course and dessert. I had shrimps for starter - 4 big gambas very tasty. For main course I had the mix grill - lot of meat and what I liked the most were the ribs. Personnel was very nice and because we had more people annouced for dinner (for which we already paid) they offered us extra food (ribbs, potatoes). I only had extra dessert: vannila icecream with hit cherries! Great food served by nice people!"
During the busy days before Christmas we were lucky to have a seat without reservation. The reception was personal and heart warming. The place is very cosy and homely. The food is just phenomenal. We had the croquet and salmon as starters and a mixed grill and a salmon as main course. The sauces of both main courses made the meal even more tasteful and delicious. A place we would definitely come back to. 
"We were brought here by friends who wanted to treat us. And boy did we get a treat. From the rillettes, bon mouches, seaside extravaganza starter (I still dream about it) and spanking fresh main fish dish. We all chose all the choices between us - and they were all fantastic. The desserts and cheesboard were sublime. Wine was chosen based on course we were eating and everything was local. The staff were knowledgeable about the food, it's sourcing and preparation, the origins of the wine and beer. It was an education and I've never been more happy to be educated. Thanks to Dorien & Marnix would took us knowing we would enjoy it. How right they were. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. I am sure you need to book it in advance. It was wall to wall on a Monday night. I've added some photos, but I also forget to take pics of some of the other, smaller courses - they were gobbled up too quickly."
"Went to have diner with my wife and 3 month old baby.Service was excellent very friendly staff who explain everything.The ordering app is also great, no need to have a paper menu in your hands or anything for that matter, everything is managed by a QR code you have to scan at your table.Food was excellent as well, they also allow you to take any leftovers home with you in small boxes.Much recommended!"
If you love hot chocolate which I seriously do then you have to try this place.We dropped by after a busy day shopping and we were lucky enough to find a spot plus the sun was still shining so we were all very happy.There's other options too but we went for the hot chocolate and we were very happy.The staff are so nice and helpful and everyone looked like they were happy to be there.The presentation is also great and a bit quirky which I always like.It's a great spot to watch the world go by too.I will be back.

"Best Indian Food Cuisine so far in Belgium. The taste, the smell and ambience all take me back home.  Mouthwatering Veg tikkas and Salads are a must try. Thank you from India."
Great two-monthly menu.
"We stumbled upon this fancy restaurant and the originality of the cuisine surprised us very much. What they do with poatoes, carrots and root vegetables and fish and seafood are truly amazing."
We reached Ghent late at night and all places near the center were only open for drinks. This was the closest kebab place open and they ensured we had some great food on our first night in the beautiful city. The durum chicken and kebab were tasty without not too greasy with a healthy serving of veggies.The fries were as good as you expect in Belgium. The service was very friendly and they helped us choose the right sauce and bread. Recommended for your late night kebab / food craving while in Ghent!
"Great kitchen full of surprises for an acceptable price
Perfect service

"The modern cookery scene in Ghent has reached a new height with Oak, the new restaurant of former 'food develloper' of Pure C Marcelo Ballardin. However, i have no doubts that he wil have outflanked his former achievements besides the spotlights with his own restaurant, where he can unleash his culinairy creativity.The welcome and service were very hearty and informal, yet correct. The interior was small, cosy, yet with a nice modern touch. The respect for traditions without forgetting modern trends is also reflected in the amazing cutlery and plates, which are very stylish, yet also informal.But the real pivot point of Oak is the exceptional cooking, which was of an extremly high level. Marcelo Ballardi succeeds in combining more traditional styles of cooking with very modern and progressive techniques, with often very original yet accurate combinations of ingredients. The beauty of this original and creative cooking is that the taste of the dishes remains the main concern of the chief. A chef of this level will be competing for major culinairy rewards and recommendations in no time (if it isn't already).To be short: check out this place before the prices and reputation catch up with the extraordinary level of this restaurant."
"An extremely welcoming small restaurant. The mixed starters and especially dim sum were well prepared. The really special aspects are the freshly home-made noodles which are incorporated into balanced dishes with quality ingredients. I had duck noodles with black bean sauce, whereas my colleague had shrimp noodles with oyster sauce. Both were carefully presented with the sauces complementing but not overpowering the other flavours. Our host was most hospitable including a much appreciated local beer recommendation. Value for money is excellent. Highly recommended. "
"We were recommended this restaurant by the owners of our hotel who are locals and it turned out to be a great suggestion. It is just 5 minutes away from the main site and located next to the canal. Attentive service and wide choice of menu. We has steaks which were fabulous and the burgers looked great. If you place a side order of fries one bag is more than enough for two people. The best restaurant we visited in Ghent by far. It does therefore get busy,,,"
"I met with some former colleagues in ""Le Magret"" on a Friday afternoon for lunch. We were welcomed by the hostess and were served with the greatest care throughout the service. Most of us chose the lunch menu and we all enjoyed high quality food that was prepared with lots of love and care."
"The food was good even though there was almost no one there. I can imagine the food being even better when it's a bit more crowded ;)

Good place to visit with groups and picky eaters! :D"
"Best pasta in Ghent! 
Whenever we feel like pasta, we come here. I wish I could say which pasta you should try but they're all delicious. that's why we always choose 3 dishes to share while there's only two of us."
"Pleasant riverside setting friendly staff but food amazing! Perfectly matched and flavoured good quality ingredients. We had fish terrine, shrimps and guacamole, then pork and fish and chips then chocolate brownie with pistachio ice cream and melon with fruit of the forest sorbet. Every single dish was excellent- must be in our top 5 restaurant meals ever"
"I was unfortunately not in the best mood since my wallet was stolen a few hours before, but we went back to 'Klaverblad after we still remembered it from 8 years ago :) Well, apart of a bit of too long waiting to my taste between the starter and the main dish, all was delicious !!! What I love is that even the amuse-bouches, that they give to every customer before the starter, even that is truly delicious !! The crème brûlée was perfect as well. We didn't go for it but the menu is a good value. Une valeur sûre, as we say ! "
"The service was good and the place was clean. Went in for a burger and fries. They don't make ""normal"" burgers like in the states. I had the Crazy Red Veggie Burger which was made with Paprika, spinach, pecans, lemon mayo and a few others I can't remember. It was very good and the bun toasted. Came with tomatoes and some wonderful Belgian Fries. They were fast and friendly. They also make a veggie burger that is supposed to taste like real hamburger but I did not want to try it because I don't like beef. They did have lots of alternatives. Great food"
"Is the first time that I found a real Italian restaurant In Belgium or Netherland!

Super service, super food and super wine.

When you left from here, you will want to go back!"
"Really enjoyed sitting outside by the river and having a big glass of REAL Belgium hot chocolate, which was made w real chocolate chips then added hot frothy milk (just 3.20 eu too). Beer looked good too!!"
"I'm a regular! I recommend roast beef with tartar sauce (the sauce is home-made ) and ham pesto mozzarella, but other sandwiches are also tasty. The ingredients are very fresh. No other restaurant (sandwiches) is comparable to this one."
"We have had several times lunch here.
Good quality food; perfect service for a great price.
Weather permitting you can sit on the terrace.
You get a cava and coffee with extras afterwards."
"Booked lunch in this small restaurant in the center of Ghent. The place was packed, mainly with locals, which is always a good sign. Very friendly staff, helpful with an English menu and detailed advice. The food was really top class, sophisticated, with pure and fresh flavors, and some unexpected combinations. Suggested wines worked beautifully with the food. Spent 80 Euro for an extensive 3 course lunch, including 3 appetizers, and 3 glasses of wine. Reservations are a must. Go there before they become too well known! "
Not in old town but close to the hospital and not so far from the Holiday Inn Express.  Very tasty and inexpensive with a friendly owner.
"Nice and warm
Very kind
Delicious
We had à free table for two. No réservation needed. À very kind manager open for discussion

We Will Come back soon"
Very nice Italian restaurant. They make very lovely food. The service is super friendly and attentive. I always go here when in the area. I would thoroughly recommend.
i had dinner with my partner and friends to celebrate my partners and her sisters 50th birthday.its a very cosy restaurant.The staff and owner are very friendly.The food was excellent.The presentation also.
"The dinner at Amadeus was an unexpected food experience. We ordered ribs. The menu is based : all you can eat. 
Certainly I would like to came back soon."
"We had the winter menu. Delicious, just come with enough time...
4 courses
1st tuna freshly backed with scallops
Then fish with trouble sauce and fresh shrimp. Unusual but tasty
Then Ree 
And now we should try crepe Suzette..."
Young and driven entrepreneurs who explain every wine (or small dish) with a positive vibe. Warm welcome. A small treasure in ghent.
"always a lot of clients. the food is always top quality, verry good wines and a friendly staff.
Peter as the frontman/chef is running the place perfect"
Sophiscated!  Beautiful presentation!  A class by itself.  Delicious with intricate balance and refreshing acidity.  Worth a special trip just for this restaurant.
"Went here with three friends, two of whom from overseas, and had a wonderful evening. We originally reserved a table for 6:45pm but due to a delay we had to call back and change the reservation to 7:30pm, which the staff was accommodating with. The atmosphere is very comfy on the ground floor. We ordered the pork jowl stew, the steak tartare and the fish waterzooi. The homemade steak tartare came pre-assembled from the kitchen but was very well seasoned and had a good amount of gherkins. The minced meat was of good quality. The stew was made with beer - the pork jowls were very tender - and it gave it a nice well rounded flavor. Our friends seemed to like the waterzooi very much. Would definitely recommend this place for nice evening at a restaurant with excellent food. Several vegetarian options on the menu and many - maybe all - organic ingredients in the dishes. Good beer and wine list too."
"This is the place to go to. Excellent food at a very fair price, great service and a cosy atmosphere. The daily menus are really value for money. One of the best places to eat steak (try the James Bond, with a really nice sauce) and stew."
"We had both coffees & Sunday lunch here & staff were very accommodating on both occasions, especially for six of us. We all ate the beef stew which was excellent. 
Would definitely recommend."
Apostrophe is located in a previous “pastorij” and is blessed with a quiet and relaxing interior.The welcoming is friendly and sincere and the general ambiance is stylish without being pretentious.The most important part is the food! We enjoyed a fine business lunch and a reasonably priced wine.A place to return to!
"Fond this mainly rib restaurant by chance , very busy seating outside on the pavement but could only find a couple of seats inside . Very helpful waitresses explained that there were four flavours of ribs we choose honey and a sweet and sour these racks came with a small loaf fresh salad four dressings and a bowl of amazing roasted new potatoes with butter and herbs , this is Belgium so great beers and a very nice white wine as soon as we cleared our plates we were offered another rack apparently the most eaten was a staggering 14 !! Highly recommend "
"A very nice and clean restaurant well located downtown Ghent.
Staff  is friendly, food is good, big portions."
"So I found Pakhuis as I was walking around the side streets of Ghent. It was raining and the place was closed. Not a great start. I persevered and went back for dinner because I had been told this brasserie was quirky, and who can resist quirky. Bingo, I arrived early without a reservation and got seated quickly in this magnificent converted warehouse. I went up a few steps beside a headless winged (I think) statue, then sat at a table looking at a bar area. The waiter was charming and provided excellent advice on the food, which I ate, of course, accompanied by a local beer (I don't think the 8% alcohol has affected my recall). I judge eateries by the care that they take in presenting the bread and butter - top marks there for Pakhius. I had an excellent locally-sourced steak followed by a molten chocolate cake with ice cream, both worthy of a Michelin establishment. When I came to pay by credit card the waiter told me I could not leave a tip. So do take some cash because you most certainly should if your experience turns out to be anything like mine."
"Visited Du Progres when we were in Ghent about 3 years ago and enjoyed our meal, so we ate at the restaurant again with positive expectations. We were not disappointed - we chose to eat inside and had a very pleasant table, and the food was delicious. Service was very professional and prompt, and the restaurant very clean and well maintained. Deservedly gets good reviews on Trip Advisor and we could not fault it."
"We had some great meals in Ghent but this was the best.Friendly and charming staff,excellent food and the best house red in Europe(probably).If your on your first visit to Ghent stop worrying and know that you will enjoy your evening here-I promise."
"Decided for this place by many reviews and i really wasnt dissapointed. They serve huge portuons of meal, staff is very friendly, atmosphere cosy and menu well combined for vegetarians as well. Altought prices are higher for Eastern Europeans, it is quite worth it"
"Pain perdu offers delicious home-made salads, toasts and sandwiches served by a young and friendly staff in a beautiful surrounding! There's also a garden in the back that's great to relax in during the sunny months :) if you wanna have a romantic breakfast, a business lunch, a place to read a book or a drink with friends, the atmosphere is perfect for any of those occasions. Be sure to visit the place if you're in Ghent! "
"Absolutely fantastic, sums up our experience this eatery. Had the beef stew and the fish with a cocktail and glass of the local wine topped with a desert. The staff were very friendly, proactive and helped with making selections. Very impressed and highly recommend. Must visit! "
"A recommendation from our lovely tour guide (Deborah at Ghent walking tours) we were delighted to find this spot.Due to its fantastic location you would think it's a tourist trap and maybe it is but everyone dining next to us was local.The beers are fantastic, the food is delicious and the service is great. This was a great spot to people watch and we had three courses each because it was so nice. Authentic Belgian food, reasonably priced (not cheap but worth the money) I loved it!"
"We were with two people there to grab some food and both had a quesadilla grande and it was extremely delicious. However, one should not expect a large variety of options to choose from as it is more a bar than a restaurant. The owners were friendly and attentive. Every Thursday and Saturday they are organizing karaoke for those who want to participate. "
"It was a cold evening so, even if the view on the canal was nice, I chose to go inside. The restaurant, actually a brasserie, although without a definite personality has some ""ambience"". There is not much room between the tables, however. The waiters and waitresses are young, efficient and nice. I chose oystsers, mussels au natural (huge) potatoes and finished with an enormous hot ""sabayon"" with vanilla icecream on the bottom. Everything was delicious. Not inexpensive, but this is by far the best restaurant I have tried in Ghent and definetely a place where I shall go again."
"What a fantastic experience, the staff were so friendly and welcoming. Be sure to book the first night we tried it was fully booked but we went back the next night and glad we did.There is a wide choice of steaks,I would have loved to try them all but alas could only eat one, maybe next time as this will be my first port of call if I return to the beautiful city of Ghent."
I came across this lovely place by chance in May 2018. It was refreshing to have some Scandinavian after a few unpalatable Belgium meals. The cafe is quite beautiful. Even for lunch there were candles on the tables. The room is brightly lit. The two open face sandwiches with pickled fish and beet salad were delicious. Highly recommend it. I also had a nice Elephant beer with my food.
"We decided to go with the curried chicken lunch special. No other ""lunch menu"" and we weren't sure about how much food we wanted. The papadam was excellent (I usually refuse). The yellow lentil soup was delicious! Curry was also great - I could have used more spice but I think they toned it down for us:) NO problem with meat quality as others suggest - it was cooked perfectly. Basmati excellent. Naan excellent. Service excellent. Wish I was there right now......"
"Excellent tagliatelle with chicken and tarragon; a lovely cream sauce with a strong flavour and tangy. Partner had there own salad, with smoked salmon, herring and king prawns, accompanied by a wonderful selection of salads and fruit,The staff were extremely friendly. We sat outdoors in the heat listening to the carillon from the clock tower. I would recommend it highly."
"Real exquisite dining: only one menu (adaptations because of allergies of intolerances are possible) available. But boy, is that menu well balanced: a variety of fish, meat, vegetables and other stuff. All in perfect combination. Without leaving with a bloated stomach. It's a hassle to book, but it's so worth it!"
"I came across this place by complete mistake. Walking alongside the quiet canal when a fairly inconspicuous A-Board caught my sight.Would recommend to reserve a table prior to arriving as the place can be fairly booked up.The setting is unusual in that it looks very temporary. Everything is made from Chip board. The Kitchen divider, the tables, the benches and the ceiling. The low hanging lanterns look great but watch your head. The temporary look can often look tacky but this place looks cool.The menu has two types of pizza, a tomato based pizza and a white pizza, which is a base with toppings but no tomato. Both taste fantastic and compliment each other when doing a half and half which is available.My favourite is the Diavola or Diavolo and i absolute drench it in the Chilli Oil which is available to give that extra buzz.I would also recommend the beer called 13. It is brewed by 'The Ministry of Belgian Beer'.So go ahead and Eat, Love, Pizza. You will i can guarantee it."
"Very generous portion of tasty big mussels in curry sauce. The fish stew is also very delicious with fresh sweet taste consists of fresh fish, scallop and salmon. 
Great service and great view overlooking the canal. Complimentary appetizers served. 
Highly recommended!"
Serves typical Belgian dishes. Food always good. Impeccable service. Great terrace looking onto Sint Baafs square.
"On a windy and cloudy day I entered this restaurant for a late solo lunch. After reading the menu, which is completely translated to English, I ordered Flemish stew - made of pork cheeks in a thick sauce flavored with dark beer and mustard, with a big bowl of fries an home made mayo. It was perfect. The best dish I had in Ghent.This place can be absolutely recommended."
"A very memorable meal. Surtido de tapas was sumptuous. House wine was fine.  

Staff friendly and helpful."
"This world champion BBQ gives credit to his title. The meat is ""absolutely fabulous and more than worth its price. The fish and lobster are also delicious. I can also recommend his ""cuberdon dessert""."
Great burgers in an original setting. Super friendly service!!! Vinyl cover placemats are a nice touch. 😉
"We had a great time, the burger was very tasty and I loved the fact that there was a matching beer with every burger in the menu. Service was excellent: quick and friendly."
"Amazing experience!
Place to be in Ghent!
Super tasteful food and very good service in a style surrounding. 
Very good"
"very nice place, cosy & romantic.
an exquisit menu with special attentions for people with intelorances.
an interested chef who comes out of his kitchen to explain whta he serves and when & how it got there.
a great moment!"
The food was fantastic. Great service. Black angus was superb. The beef stew etc. We will come back. Keep up the great work 👍🏻
"If you love authentic Chinese food, I can recommend you to go to this restaurant. The cook is from Chongqing, and they also have some authentic spicy dishes on the menu. The staff is really friendly, and even gave us some travel tips for our future travel to Chongqing.Both spicy and non-spicy dishes were really delicious and tasted like the dishes I had in China. Only downside is that the restaurant kitchen already closes at 20:00."
"The food and drinks were very tasty,  staff super friendly and we loved the interiour!
Highly recommended when you are visiting Gent.  The place is popular so better make a reservation!"
"Wide variety of beers, along with detailed flavor descriptions. Music and services are great too! Being on a boat makes the atmosphere quite suggestive"
The food was amazing. Service was great. We enjoyed it. This is our new favorite spot in Ghent. We will be asap back.
"It was on the colder side when we visited, but, when we heard there's such a restaurant in Gent serving all you can eat ribs, man! We definitely had to check it out. And it didn't disappoint! Racks of ribs just keeps coming for as long as you can keep eating. I ordered it with a side of potatoes (with all the fixings on it) and some hot chocolate because, why the heck not? It's Belgium after all, and it was cold lol. And we had a great time (even though your table will be much closer to your neighbor than you are probably used to). Will absolutely return when we visit Gent again. "
"We stayed in the Air Bnb upstairs as well as getting breakfast the next morning, and I really regret waiting until it was too late to leave an Airbnb review. The place was absolutely fantastic!!The all you can eat breakfast was amazing, it was great quality m, and was very accommodating for us as vegetarians. He was also very helpful in advice on things to do around Ghent, and very very chatty. Would love to visit the city again soon just to stay here again and to have the breakfast. The host really loves what he’s doing and wants to know if he can help you have a great time in the city"
"Great, friendly place with really exceptional food. I have been in Belgium for a month now and t Stoveke was one of the best meals i've eaten since arriving. Friendly staff, great atmosphere."
"We chose De Rave from previous tripadvisor reviews and were delighted with our evening. This is a small restaurant but perfectly formed. The décor and table ware are simple and beautiful, the welcome friendly but serious, and the food was consistently wonderful. we chose the menu of the day with supplement which meant that house wines carefully matched to each course were included. For us this was a perfect meal."
"The old brasserie d'ouwe smisse, well known in the region and nicely located in the pretty village of Huise, has now been totally renovated. The young cook and his wife (Siel and Manon) gave new life to the place and present an excellent food. We visited it for the first time and were enthusiastic about the beef tartare and the shrimps. This is more than just bistro-kitchen."
"We stumbled upon this restaurant but the menu looked good. I wanted to get Waterzooi some place during our stay. It looked like a good place. My husband got the Vlaamse stoverij which was a Flemish beef stew. We both got drinks. My husband's meal came with a salad. When they brought our plates, my husband's stew looked like a very small amount. I told him he would be hungry. That was before they put the rest of his stew beside him! He had a another bowl of stew! I had a tureen of the Waterzooi with a half of chicken in it! And, it was delicious! So was my husband's meal. We began a conversation with the table next to us and they said it was their third night there. They had eaten something different every night. The prices were very reasonable in my opinion. The service was good and the food outstanding. I wanted to go back the next night, but it was a 30 minute walk from our hotel and we were tired. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
My boyfriend and I went two days in a row because not only was the food amazing but the owners are super friendly and passionate about their restaurant. We had the Dim Sum pork dumplings which were fantastic. He had the soup which he loved and I had the home made noodle stir fry! We will be going back tomorrow! Loved it. 
"My husband and I had a lovely evening at this restaurant. Don't expect white table cloths and fine dining… It's relaxed with a vintage decor and offers generous & tasty meals. I had the fish stew and my husband had the traditional Gentse Stoverij which was delicious and huge! We had a dessert each, a bottle of wine and a beer which came to 66 euros. Quite reasonable for an enjoyable night."
"Everything was good food, wine, beer, ambience and service was very good it could not be faulted will return at a later date."
"Visited here for a breakfast as a family and had a really great feed! Super menu and nice service. We went for the classic sweet selection as well as some scrambled eggs with salmon and also some granola with yoghurt, along with coffees and orange juice. Lovely environment, good big tables, plus there is a nice garden at the rear that could be used."
"We go very frequently to Bistro Illyrian because we feel great, eat the most delicious food, drinnk the most impressive wines and receive the best service. Gent might have great restaurants but overall the service is horrendous. Bistry Illyrian excells in its service. Egzon is a great waiter and the cooks are just amazing. Highly recommended."
A large choice of vegetarian and vegan dishes. Tried the Mexican vegan burger and it was excellent! Healthy and natural food. Totally recommend it
"A group of four, we recently dined at ‘tKlaverbad opting for the prix fixe menu with wine. The inside of the restaurant is very tastefully decorated, the owners show great attention to detail (including a supply of reading glasses !) and the tables are dressed beautifully. As for the food,we were all very impressed with every course and the choices available. Dinner began with a luxurious aperitif, followed by delicious entrees, main courses and a varied selection of tempting desserts. Both wines served were high quality and our glasses were replenished throughout the main courses.The owner and her colleague were very professional, attentive and friendly. We were given a warm welcome and at no time did we feel rushed.We had a wonderful dining experience, wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a visit to this outstanding restaurant and indeed look forward to returning there ourselves next time we visit the beautiful city of Ghent.Many thanks to the team at ‘tKlaverbad!"
"we managed to get seats at the bar--inventive menu, eel tart, pigeon, cheese board, friendly atmosphere..lots of fun
open for lunch , too"
"This is a wonderful restaurant in a great location. Set in a beautiful period townhouse overlooking the canal, the dining room is really charming. The staff were fantastic and the food was delicious. It is quite expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. Our waiter was extremely generous and friendly and gave us plenty of tips about visiting the city. Book in advance or it is very likely that you won’t get a table."
"Great restaurant, with very nice decoration and here comes the best... no matter how much you will eat, you will pay the same! The ribs are delicious! and the potato with that sauce was magnificent! don't miss it!"
"Was really happy to find this restaurant in Gent
Had a lovely meal zeebaas was excellently cooked enjoyed it very much with glass moscatel. They were very friendly indeed already recommended it to my friends definitely go back again for sure"
"Well decorated,like a tearoom should look like. They also have a terrace in the back. Coffee and pastries are delicious. Service is a bit slow ,but in this setting not a worry Also recommend alice the magazin just a few blocks up the street. Great sandwiches to go and very decent prices. Also a very well decorated store. I recommend both."
"Great food, charming hosts and warm welcome from Clyde. Even is Flanders to arrive on bike to such a warm welcome for 11 hungry cyclists was exceptional. Try this place. If you don't like it maybe you don't deserve it. We diverted off our planned route to come back two days running. Thank you "
Friends and I went for a meal here last night 23rd Feb. We had a selection of items off the menu and all of them were delicious. We all had waffles for desert and they were the best we’d ever had..... light fluffy ... very tasty. The service was fantastic ... we’d definitely go back!!
"Great restaurant in the heart of the historic center of Ghent. Been here a few times now and absolutely love it!
I can recommend the Morocan tomato soup and the tajines."
"The food was extremely tasty, the interior is very nice & cozy, the cocktails are delicious and the staff & the cook were very friendly. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!"
As good as in India.The food was soooooo amazing and the service was so friendly! Thank you for this amazong experience!!! 
"First would like to reply to those people that are not used to a ,,real’’ pizza.Rule no one:when ordering pizza,you should know yourself how you like it and,then you order it.I’ve been to Italy bit to the south east west north and even southwest. I am addicted to pizza. And one of the best I’ve eat at Da Adriano. Rule number two: when you go to the restaurant and there is something you don’t like or you like to say,then you do it straight away. That’s the only way you can make it better. Not going home and then feel important enough and write down all of your life frustrations. Adriano could teach many ,what a real pure Italian kitchen is about.Bravo Adriano"
"There's not much to say: very cosy atmosphere, great food, great service. No complaints, highly recommended."
"A fine place to enjoy a fantastic dinner, they have all the time in the world for their guest, serve a good aperitive with amuse's all very smotth and nobody seems to be in a hurry. Between tables there's a lot of space. They also serve a good wine together with the dishes. We enjoyed ourselves on different occasions specially when we have something to celebrate."
"I came for a quick meal just before closing time. They even wanted to open a terace for me. I asked for a suggestion what to eat. The meal(dumplings and beef with peanuts) was very nicely prepared and tasty. Eventhou i was only person in the restoran, there were no rush. I would suggest every one to go there."
"My wife and I had dinner here and we found the food great and the host and hostess to be very friendly, observant and helpful. We had oysters for starters, followed by each a different traditional Belgian dish and these were very tasty and well prepared. What blew us away was the home-made Tiramisu, the best we ever had ! When we visit Ghent again we will definitely come back here !"
"Nice location and very friendly staff, I loved the idea to sit around the massive table next to other guests in the main room, highly recommended for breakfast the croque monsieur was great"
"Really cool place serving very good pizza and a reasonable range of beers. As well as the usual it is worth noting that there are also a couple of vegan offerings on the menu. The staff are friendly and helpful, the prices are good value."
"This is a wonderful bar/brasserie full of cycling photos, original relics,vintage jerseys, bottles, all dedicated to great bike races and cyclists.Besides, food is very good : the stew with chips is done in typical way, with super kwaremont beer.I have been here after RetroRonde race, and i was satisfied for everything."
"We were in Ghent for 1 day only and I'm so glad we had our lunch here! You must try the toasted sandwich with chicken & avocado! Really recommend it, had a great lunch!"
"We enjoyed our dinner very much! The location in the old warehouse is just perfect for a restaurant! The dishes were delicious and the staff was very friendly and attentive. For the taste and quality of the food, the prices are absolutely reasonable. If we visit Ghent again we already know where we'll have dinner :)"
Really good friend chicken  nuggets - we ordered the salad and the wrap and both were delicious - as were the yummy fries!  Wonderful outdoor dining and fun people watching.
"I really hesitate to let the world know about our favourite restaurant as it is already hard to get in. For a start it is very small (and I think the owner is very happy to leave it that way so he can give a truly personalised service. Last time we wanted to go (just two little people), it was full. We've had lobster there, and game, and steak - it is always excellent. I had an enormous plate of carpaccio as a starter but didn't like the oil used. A pleasant, informative conversation ensued and, although we are infrequent visitors since we don't live nearby, the next time I ordered it, it came with a jug of another oil for me to dose it myself! What a fantastic memory! However, the best bit is the sabayon! I like it made with white beer instead of sweet liqueur (a tip from a wonderful restaurant in Brussels which puts beer into every dish, including desserts!) so I asked . . . Sure enough, the wonderful boss found a suitable beer (he didn't have a witbier) and made it to order! Is it any wonder the customers flock back to this tiny place hidden behind the main square?"
"By all means fanny about before choosing a restaurant in Gent, but know there is on your doorstep a fantastic Indian restaurant.

As good as it gets without spending huge amounts or going to India."
This time we went there for a Wedding reception and it was just great again!!!The garden is well maintained and decoration was really nice. The welcoming was really nice as well as the drinks and the food.It's always nice to be recognized as we had our wedding there as well a few years ago. We just love to go there over and over again!!!
"This restaurant has very good food, service and atmosphere . Good value I would highly recommend to anyone looking for quality t affordable prices"
"I have just had a delicious 3 course meal in this restaurant and wow what a meal, started with Scallops, followed by Ham hock, and 3 chocloate mouse desert. Service was great, atmosphere was lovelly and very very busy for a wet and windy Tuesday in January.Restaurant has Michelin 2013 Bib Gourmand and is well deserved offering a fine selection of oyster and lobster dishes if you fancy either. Well worth a visit if budget is no issue. 3 course meal plus bottle of average wine cost roughly 90 Euro"
"Having had a long journey, we decided to eat in the hotel....not our normal choice. What a great surprise though. The Sushi platter and the Dim Sum selection were just excellent and really good value for money. Wish this place was closer to home!"
"Only had 1 night to explore Ghent and stopped off here to recharge. Ordered two family portions of fries, some sauces (the pepper sauce is delicious) and a few beers and it only cost 15euro, so full marks for value! The food was excellent and we’d have no doubt returned if we'd had a longer stay."
"We stumbled into this restaurant on a rainy night and the owner was kind enough to give us a table even though he was fully booked. The food was wonderful, exactly what one would expect from a good Italian restaurant. We enjoyed the veal scallopini and the ravioli with goat cheese was so good that we made a reservation for the following night. The restaurant is small so reservations are a must. No tourists here, everyone was a local. We dined here 5 nights and never ran out of things to order. Everything was excellent. Bravo I’ll Folletto!"
"The food was amazing, delicious and you can feel Every ingrediënt in the plate, for sure i Will go again."
"One of my favourite restaurants in Gent. The owners are always friendly, even when it is very busy. The food is always excellent. The interior my kind of cosy. 

see you next time!"
Only stayed in Ghent for 3 nights and returned here each of those nights. Great atmosphere and even better selection of beers and the best value for money good quality food we've had - the ribs is a no brainer!
"Marvelous and cosy little restaurant in centre of Gent.
Amazing Surprise to discover a piece of Italy where You Can eat exellent food made with original raw material and passion. Advise: taste the Tiramistacchio!!!!! wonderful!"
verry nice food
A very nice restaurant with sophisticated food and great service. You'll be in for a treat coming here for dinner.
"Called in for a midday meal,and chose from the midday menu.not as much choice as normal menu but cannot complain..Lady of the house super friendly,restaurant has nice atmosphere and most of all food is superb..its the best in the area in my opinion"
"Visited with my wife whilst on holiday in Belgium, and this was a wonderful find. We had a fantastic meal in the cosy setting with friendly staff, and the food was delicious."
"I ate multiple times at Indian curry house, every time a different dish and every time I was amazed how good everything is! I ate vegetarian dishes, chicken dishes and with lamb. My friends also like it very much. Very happy also with the service there, everyone is so happy and friendly. It feels like home. Very good!!"
"Went here to full up the car. While waiting inside the gas station I was checking out the menu for Lunch Garden and the menu as well as the food looked pretty good. I got a special offer and pais €10 for a grilled piece of salmon, fries and vegetables, a drink and desert! Amazing! Even more amazing that it was absolutely delicious. The chef realy seems to know what he is doing and my salmon and fries were freshly prepared and it tasted realy very good. Price quality this place has propably the best deal on all high ways in Belgium."
"Family-run Indian restaurant, one of the best in town! Lovely people, great meals! We keep going back, it’s so nice!"
"We had scrabble eggs with bread and bacon , banana bread and croissant ! Really tasty food and polite service ! A good breakfast spot 😉😉"
"Delicious food, exquisite and very well presented. What is charming here is the outdoors tables in the backyard garden, where you can enjoy your meal under a sunny day. The price is a bit above the average (starters + main course + dessert + glass of wine) for about 40€ or more, but it's a great dining experience, especially for business gatherings."
"We had our drinks before dinner along the borders of the Lys. Dinner was just excellent well prepared, served and presented. We had a perfect dinner with friends after a hard day of work on the golfcourse of St Martens-Latem.
We will return"
When you arrive at this unimposing place expectations are not that high. But when we started with our meal my partner and I could not stop praising our delightful plates of Escalope Special. This will be a place to revisit really soon.
"We went for lunch and the special today was wonderful. Food was fresh and how it cooked was very delicious, service and environment were great.. 😊 thank you."
"We made our reservation 4 months ahead but it was worth waiting for.I must admit, not easy to find a parking spot close to the restaurant, the entrance is even a bit hard to find and the interior decoration is rather minimal.But the food and the price makes up for these small attention points. All courses were excellent, I have no remarks at all on the food. Flavours from around the world, innovative ways of cooking, excellent tastes, really delicious. And all of this for a very reasonable price. It won't take long before this restaurant gets awarded.The selection of the drinks is rather limited and can still be improved (or that's my opinion at least)."
"Ate here twice. An historic old building filled top to bottom with memorabilia. Service the first time was excellent, the second time it was good. The first time we both enjoyed the Ghent Flemish Stew - delicious, very tender chunks of meat served in a casserole dish to share, with potatoes and salad. The waiter helped us choose a beer to accompany our dinners, and it was great. The second time dining here, my husband chose the Stew again, but I opted for the bratwurst served over a mashed potato mixture that was awesome. Climb the stairs to the toilets to see lots of other eclectic memorabilia."
A very beautiful restuarant that offers great value for the money. Some of the best chocolate-mousse I’ve ever had.
"The restaurant is very tiny and the decorations could be better. Anyway, the lady who received us (also who served us and cooked for us) was so friendly and gentil. They have 4 different kinds of soup, and we ordered the tomato soup and the leek and vegetables soup. The tomato soup was the best I ever tried, and I'm a great fan of tomato soup! The price was really cheap (too much in my opinion), and the quality was supreme!"
"It is a shame that the artist who created the marvelous ceiling sculpture is never mentioned ! He is a French artist, named Jean-Pierre Clémençon ,who spent nearly 40 years in the city of Ghent, and is now living in France , Dordogne. Such a pity that the Parnassus never placed his name board. I hope trip advisor will inform by now his travellers. Only for the sculpture this place is worth seeing !!"
"We had been recommended by a friend to go to this restaurant who had eaten here previously. We are certainly glad we did. We had a plate of ribs that came out with a side salid and a curry Jacket Patatoe. Once that was finished they gave us more ribs. Once they had gone we had even more ribs and another potatoe. The staff just kept serving you until you went pop!The drinks were fairly well priced, the staff are very friendly and the service very quick. The decor of the room is also very impressive. We tried to eat here without a reservation and was unable to get in. The next day we booked so had no problems. Reservations therefore are a must. There is a phone number on the window to book a table when it's closedNo room for a desert but for just under €16 it is a bargain and a must eat place"
"Really nice place to have a cozy brunch. It has a large buffet where you can get all sorts of food, salads, cheese, pastries, warm buffet and coffee and teas. We came a little early and missing one person but the lady behind the counter was super nice and accomodating. The food was delicious and fresh, would go back there anytime. Thank you "
"I visited once again during gent festival and o must say even whole being full house they found us a table in few mins and once again incredible experience at royal India.  Authentic food and hospitality at its best , keep it up guys"
"Visiting Ghent, the city of the 3 towers? Close to the Castle? Don't go to the mainstream addresses: go to this brasserie: very good price/quality rate, home made and good tasting food. I'd recommend to make a reservation as there are plenty of 'habitués' who come along... The ice cake with ""salty caramel"" is ""gorgeous""!"
"We love ancient bicycles, bicycle history, crazy bicycles, and general geekiness. Mr. Lieven has a relaxed personality with visitors and his pub (at present somewhat condensed) boasts an amazing collection of bicycles, train lamps, and other items in an appealingly eccentric atmosphere. Very first time I ever saw a shaft driven bicycle (like this: ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quadrant_Shaft_Driven_Bicycle.JPG) as well as a tricycle with an unusual chain that seemed to be made out of wood-framing staples (I sadly failed to get a picture and am still trying to find out what that was). TAKE YOUR CAMERA! I failed to do so this time, but intend to the next time we are in Gent/Ghent/Gand."
"The Stoverij stew is famous in Belgium and is one of their specialist dishes. During my visit I had tried this dish is a number of different restaurants, though the one in the restaurant was by far the best. At €17, it wasn't the cheapest of the dishes I tried, but it was definitely worth every penny. The restaurant has a large selection of beers to choose from, and has a view of the canal while you eat, which creates a nice atmosphere also."
"Really nice burgers and starters, catering for carnivores as well as vegetarians/vegans. In the centre of the city."
"We have been to this restaurant several times the past few months and everytime it is a delight to dine and be served. Not cheap but worth every penny, you see the chef preparing your dish behind the counter, the service is discreet yet very friendly and efficient. This is a must-visit for every japanese foodlover."
"So, you drive on a long road, full of car concessions, restaurants and brothels, until you reach L'Homard Bizarre, a classy restaurant fronting this main road. Decor in shades of slate and grey, a multitude of candles, enough space around the table not to be overheard.This week's menu included: venison carpaccio with fois gras, with a 2014 Muscat; wild pigeon broth; fillet of wild boar; (with Cotes du Rhone); pears with nut ice cream, toffee brittle, chocolate fondant. All scrumptious, beautifully presented, excellent service."
Absolutely incredible experience!!! We had a wonderful night and shared an amazing moment together for Valentine’s Day
Dipping into this charming bar is like taking a trip back in time. This traditional Belgian hostelry has bucket-loads of warmth and character. Their comprehensive beer menu offers something for everyone. Why not get a sense of history by winding your way up the careworn staircase to their low-ceilinged upstairs room where you can cosy up and have a good chat with friends. Be sure to order a delicious bowl of cheeses and salami as the perfect accompaniment to the beer!
"Very friendly and charming host. Excellent tapas 
, delicious wine along with an excellent wine cellar, great atmosphere, a real find"
"Had a meal for two at the bridge, excellent front of house staff, kind and friendly. Food was good and the portion sizes were amazing.  Some good beers and wines on offer too, enjoyable experience."
Since I have been to Italy i stopped eating carbonara in Belgium until one day I stopped here and taste the best carbonara in Belgium. If you are in Gent and craving some Italian delish the place to be.
"I researched restaurants and made lunch and dinner reservations before getting to my European destinations. Very important since all restaurants chosen were top flight and booked. Maison Elza was one of the stars in our 3 day visit to Ghent. It was a most delightful and delicious lunch and Freddy the owner made the experience all the more enjoyable! The cozy vintage ambiance, candlelit table, attractively plated and delicious food were all so perfect. One could not have asked for more, and I am an extremely fussy woman concerning restaurants and food. Charming Maison Elza is a gem, not to be missed when in the beautiful city of Ghent. Yvonne McGrath/New York"
"After reading such good reviews we decided to eat here during a flying visit to Gent. We were not disappointed! This place is beautiful, the waiter we had was lovely and the food delicious. We opted for the more expensive of the two options and dined in the Beef Eater rather than the brasserie. You can choose your cut of meat from the fridge and they cook it to perfection as you request.Desserts here were also very good - my husband sampled 'the colonel' which is lemon sorbet drenched in vodka! Strong, but awesome. Would highly recommend and if we ever were in Gent again would eat here."
"This is a very nice Vietnamese restaurant. Nice, modern interior. Very friendly staff. And the food is absolutely delicious. I had Bo Xao La Hue, which was rice with a large variety of vegetables, beef and basil and I can recommend it. But I think whatever you choose, it's very good. Prices are very reasonable. I will certainly come back."
"The food at this restaurant was top-notch Italian!! The owner was fluent in Italian and I had a great time talking to him, and he made us feel special and welcome. The restaurant was cozy and inviting. The food was so authentic and high quality. I would so recommend the burrata, it was the chef's specialty and it was to die for!! One thing that the owner did to make us feel so special was make a custom panna cotta that was nut-free for my daughter, at no extra cost. He truly cared."
"AKA Elliot House this wonderful venue is hosted by the owner (Elza's grandson) and just a couple of staff. We stopped in for brunch at 10:30 on a Saturday and were lucky to get a table on the canal terrace. A ""Groot"" meal brought prosciutto, cheese, soft boiled egg, croissant, crusty roll, whole grain breads, local handcrafted jams, coffee/tea and orange juice squeezed after we ordered from fresh oranges. Refills on the coffee/tea and breads were offered. A delight - everything was delicious. Our 2 brunches came to €36.00.Highly recommended."
"Great service, great burgers, great atmosphere. I can highly recommand this burger restaurant, been there yesterday with family and some friends!"
"We only intended on having a quick drink but after seeing the food being served we had to try it, and it didn't disappoint. Good quality,homemade food. Lovely friendly staff and reasonably priced. 5/5"
I'm almost ashamed to admit that my family and I had dinner here THREE nights in a row. That's how much we loved it!!! Only my sister is vegetarian but we all loved the food there so much. It's buffet style and a typical portion for an adult would cost around 7-9 euros. The quality of the food was excellent. Everything tasted so fresh and wholesome. It was the perfect place for a light dinner after guzzling Belgian moules and frites and chocolate for a whole day. Don't forget to try their soya milkshakes - such a treat!!
"Nice cozy place and you're also welcome to only have a drink, coffee or thee.The staff was friendly and their organic coffee is nicely presented (see photo). Very smooth, silky blend. The hidden gem is their canal terrace, but also their front view is adorable. I'll another review when I have a chance to eat here, but I already highly recommend it solely based on their coffee, presentation, staff and overall 'feel of the place."
"Very nice indian food and very friendly staff. We had paneer tikka masala, mango lassi and mango chicken, all were really good and tasty."
"Very healthy thai wok cuisine, rice in abundance , fresh vegetables in abundance, wonderfull choice of sauces all at a very democratic price, choice between fish meat and vegetarian..."
"My wife suggested that we try the Hofke for Valentine's dinner instead of one our normal favorite haunts as she has heard great things about the restaurant. Trip Advisor also showed mostly excellent reviews and we decided that we had to give it a try. And what a fortunate decision. We were extremely impressed and the Hofke jumped to the top of our list in one evening. From our arrival when we were met by super friendly and helpful staff to our departure was nothing other than phenomenal. Like my wife mentions, ""I was not even allowed to stow my scarf in my jacket's sleeve, it was done FOR me"". By the end of the evening we were also taken for a tour of the restaurant as it was our first evening and I think the staff could sense that we were more than content with you dinner and visit. A really nice touch was providing a small table hook for the ladies' handbags so that the bags could be close but not in the way or on the ground. The presentation of the food is imaginative and always left one looking forward to the next dish. Food was simply amazing and from the first bite of the breadsticks made to look like branches, to the delectable sweets with coffee, we were entranced. One of the best meals I've ever had and worth every cent. Gina, the co-owner was attentive and passed each and every table frequently to ask how things were going and to make suggestions if asked. Staff were also attentive and very professional and each and every one could be pulled through a ring. And I have to add, attentive, yet never annoying and bothersome. The perfect balance between taking care of patrons yet giving enough space to be able to enjoy a special meal with someone special. Without a doubt I recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to experience a fantastic meal in a beautiful setting with a delightful atmosphere. Really top notch!"
"Always looking for a homely feel abroad, I got much more in Royal India. The place exudes all the warmth of Rajasthan as the owners, who hail from there, make sure to treat you like a Royal. I had visited on a day when I was fasting and could eat only once the whole day. I am glad I chose Royal India as they took utmost care to keep all the ingredients totally separate from meat(a true Hindu meal). Not just that, I was offered a little something to munch on the go..on the house! Royal India .. truly Royal "
"A lovely place which, if it has any faults, I have been unable to detect them. Perhaps a little busy at peak hour? Fresh, tasty and healthy foods - quiches, along with salads featuring at least one type of bean (boon in Flemish). All accompanied by the best flat white in Ghent, in the opinion of this fussy Australian coffee drinker. Topped off by charming staff and effective wifi, via which I’m uploading this review."
"Their set menu is good value, their Cote A Los is amazing.  On site parking, friendly staff and watch the Chef in action."
"Our second visit to this fabulous restaurant did not let us down. The menu for this month was phenomenal, with my favourite being the fish plate. Still recommended and my number 1 restaurant in Belgium. Yumm!"
"Visited with a big group of people
Very tasty menu all dishes were frech and good portions the meat here is outstanding and very good portions. Fresh and good what do you want more !
Il will be back Tony ( TOGO2050 groupe)"
"This cafe is an amazing oasis of beautiful antics and lovely food! Have been here for a lunch several times, also their apple pancake with grand marnier is excellent. If you order grand cafe you wont be disappointed neither :)"
Wonderful place. Great fresh food! Italian food like it should be. Friendly people. Just go and enjoy!
Top! Very good. Fresh. Nice staff. Relaxed atmosphere. Happy to have found this place. Will surely recomand.
Been a long while since I’ve experienced this kind of quality. I’ve had a wonderful evening! The food and atmosphere was simply amazing.
This is an amazing restaurant with Mexican food served like you have never tasted before. The restaurant's decor is awesome and the owners and staff are very friendly and outgoing. The food is Mexican but with a global flair and presentation that is unique. Try the braised bone marrow dish as an appetizer and try your hardest not to order a second portion.All the dishes we tasted were incredible and we tasted a lot of them.When next in Ghent this will be my goto restaurant. You will not be disappointed if you visit. 
"The food here is amazing, and the service is super friendly. Each menu comes with 4 falafel in a pita bread with sauce (tahini, chili, or aioli), a side of delicious hummus and/or wonderfully smoky baba ganoush, and a pick 'n mix salad from the salad bar. Be warned: the chili sauce is nice and hot. Value for money is fantastic - between 4 and 5 euro."
"I eat out a lot in Aalst with co-workers and 
we all love this place!It's clean and friendly,with a nice open atmosphere.
Be sure to order the ribs!"
"Absolutely great!
Exquisite food, very good wine list.
The hosts and the service are fantastic!
For sure on top 5 in Belgium"
"We were told we would be full - wow, they kept coming around offering more ribs and potatoes. Luckily, we sat with a perfect view of the kitchen and it was fun watching the well organized staff prepare plate after plate. The ribs were good, but not the best I ever had. The potato topping was superb. Would gladly go back."
"there were 3 soups on offer the day we visited, 4euros for a small bowl, 5 for a large. croutons and cheese came at no extra cost. The bowls were put on a tray with bread rolls, butter, an apple, cutlery and a napkin. The soup was delicious and piping hot. every time we passed by the place was full of people especially at lunch and many were locals which is usually a good sign."
"It's been a while since we last went there, and I only remember having followed the waitress' suggestion. Friendliness : check, speed : check, timing between the courses : check, atmosphere : check. We had a great evening there, and being from Ghent area myself, there's a good chance that we'll be a returning customer. Keep up the good work!"
We stumbled across this gem and it did not disappoint- friendly male staff - charming in 3 languages- and delicious grilles - the specialty of the establishment Asparagus was at its peak and served in the Flemish way with butter and egg and the French onion soup was dark in colour andDeliciousThe crown of lamb was perfectly grilled according to each of our taster (very rare for him and medium for me) and the frites were hot and freshMy only complaint concerns the side salad which was generous and delightful but only lightly dressed in a typically Belgian mayonnaise concoction- how I long for an acidic balsamic dressing when eating rich food!
"We stayed in Belgium for a week and this was the best meal we had. Order any of the dishes with goat cheese. So delicious. My kids loved it, too."
Came here after a recommendation from Simon Says B&B where we were staying. Small friendly restaurant with excellent staff and a nice atmosphere. Food was really fresh and only a small menu so you know you are getting what is in season. Prices reasonable for a good restaurant in Ghent. Well worth a visit.
"Since opening, we have visited repeatedly, each time bringing friends and family to enjoy the experience. Royal India is a family owned business that serves delicious food and welcomes every guest as a close friend. Recently we celebrated our anniversary at Royal India and the owners went out of their way to make our night extra special.They strive to make sure everyone feels welcome at their place, by offering a variety of choices on their menu (vegetarian, vegan etc).Food is cooked with fresh ingredients, service is always friendly and fast.If visiting Gent, check out Royal India, you will not regret it!"
"Cannot rate the food here highly enough - I chose Chilli con Carne from the menu, and it was delicious: huge pieces of lean beef in a rich and tasty sauce.  My husband had lamb stew in beer, which was equally well received.  The server...More"
"A great meal elsewhere meant we had high expectations. Colossians had all we wanted and more. Great food,very good value and friendly, relaxing service. Not phased at all when our entire take order 2 mains. (Tough flanders day on the pedals had taken its toll). Offer our large group an excellent table in the heart of the restaurant. Great beer menu and excellent house wine. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend or return. Book though, word has clearly got round that theses guys are good. "
The waiters were very kind and the food was very very good. they also have a lot of vegan options which are amazing. I really liked it :)
"My first time in this restaurant and had a fabulous experience the food quality was extremely fantastic the taste was authentic and the service of the wait staff was very attentive. I am not a spicy food lover but my wife is but this restaurant change my perception of Thai cuisine and from now on I will keep coming back to this restaurant. What really made me love this restaurant is the wait staff was very attentive when I informed I am not a spicy food lover and they immediately recommended me food which I could enjoy and prepared to my liking plus checked on my table as to how the food tasted and was it too my likings. We don’t get many restaurants which meets such criteria of a 5 star restaurant nowadays but Kin Khao definitely made us enjoy the food quality the food presentation was great, a 5 star service and a great ambiance. I sincerely Thank you for an amazing time and will definitely comeback and recommend to my friends and family."
"In Draabstrat, a short walk away from the centre in a quieter street.  Great pasta dishes, albeit huge and far too much for me to eat in one sitting.  Friendly waiters and prompt service even when they were very busy"
"Great curries, great beer selection and of you hang around at THE communal table--great conversation."
"If you want to sit on the lovely terrace, you'll need to book in time. Also inside, which is probably even more beautiful for the eyes is hard to find a table on a Monday night. Very centrally located. Great choices of food with seasonal additions to the menu. Both the asparagus as a starter and the seafood choices for main were excellent."
"We decided to have a supper in the Libanese snack, however, when we entered the restaurant, all seats were occupied and the staff warmly apologized for that and suggested a short walk and coming later. When we came later, a table was being prepared for us :-). We ordered a falafel and a huge plate full of grilled vegetable. As a gift, we got a big plate of hummus and pita bread. All the dishes were delicious, we really enjoyed it, and for a good price as well. We stayed there until the closing time and at the end, when we were leaving the restaurant, the waiter came out to say good bye and not to miss us. We were really satisfied with the meals and pleased by the staff friendliness and it made our day! Hope to be back someday!"
"When I visit family in Belgium, we also fit in a visit to Ghent. The Amadeus at Belfort - Gouden Leeuwplein is a must for us. The service is excellent, waiting ages for service does not exist here! I love the prawns, the rest of our party usually have the ribs, which are replenished as often as you can eat them! Repeat jacket potatoes for all. I love the idea of putting large bottles of wine on the table, then, at the end of your meal, they measure how many glasses have been consumed and charge accordingly.I would not visit Ghent without a meal at the Amadeus. It has outdoor seating in the summer and at the Ghent Festival. You must book to get a table!"
"We had a very nice evening there.
We ate very good and we drink very good. 
Friendly people on a cosy place. 
We’ll be back !!"
"We went here for an early evening meal family meal. The restaurant is in the heart of town and so I was expecting overpriced food and unhelpful service that is common with restaurants that do not have to try hard to get customers. However, I was pleasantly surprised the friendly and efficient staff. The food was good and they even had a kids menu which we found were few and far between on our trip."
Seemed like everything was closed after the festival and i was walking to an Italian 30 min away from my hotel. Came across this place. Great wine list. I love the Haxzimichalis cab and it was very reasonably priced. Great food great service. I even brought the menu back to my hotel Marriott to share with other guests.. great.. don’t hesitate to go there. .
"Despite the Covid restrictions, we enjoyed a very nice breakfast in a nicely organised restaurant. Designed with a good taste. Not overwhelming, simple design. Good place to be."
This tiny restaurant provided amazing food! I was very impressed with it. The name serves it justice. It's a must visit when looking for a place to eat in Ghent!
"called in here to watch the football. Very helpful manager and staff.
God selection of Belgian beers"
"We enjoyed a very leisurely lunch here during our visit to Ghent. The location is good--on a side street not from from Ghent's central square. The ambience of the restaurant is superb. The restaurant is housed in a former textile factory; it's large with two floors and beautiful details in the bar area and dining room. Although it's an old space, it has a modern feel; there is a lot of light and the high ceilings give the dining room an airy feel.Service was superb. Our server was extraordinarily welcoming, inquiring where we were from and seeming genuinely interested in us having a great meal AND a great time in Belgium.There was a very nice beer and cocktail list; as a gin and tonic lover, I especially appreciated that this restaurant had paired tonics with slightly different flavors to match the kind of gin! I had a danish gin with a coriander tonic that was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Others enjoyed their wine, too.They were offering a price-fixed lunch that included a soup starter (artichoke--smooth and delicately flavored) and either salmon or pasta. Three people had the salmon and all really enjoyed it; it was perfectly cooked, with a pink center. I had ravioli, and it was delicious; the tomato sauce was fresh and had just the right amount of acidity. The only disappointment was dessert; it was a ""pineapple carpaccio"" with a coconut ice cream. While visually interesting, the pineapple was sliced so thinly that it lost its juiciness, which is essential to pineapple having flavor.Highly recommended. Also, note that the restaurant has a large outdoor patio that would be a good option, too."
"Great wines and splendid oysters created some of our lovely memories. 

Owner is a well known chef adapting his kitchen to today’s taste trends, locally selected and in balance.."
"This is a slightly more expensive restaurant, but the food is good quality and the service that is provided by staff is outstanding. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, with generous side salads and nice canapés provided to start. Worth the money in my opinion. We did not have desserts or starters but the mains were excellent."
"Had a short break in Gent last week, and seeing the reviews on Trip Advisor, thought we'd try it out.Went there twice - both at lunchtime - place deserted when we went in - absolutely packed 30 minutes later !My wife, whose parents are from southern italy, had a southern italian speciality, and thought that it tasted really good, and very authentic, whereas I had a pizza first time, and the lasagne second time. Both the pizza and the lasagne were really nice.The service was good, with Antonio the waiter from Bari in Italy, trying his best to speak English, and when failing, talking to my wife in italian dialect . Apparently his brother, is the chef - but neither own the restaurant.The only fly in the ointment was when we asked for water to go with the wine, we were charged nearly 4 euros for bottled water, when we really wanted tapwater.But overall, it's a great place to eat, nice atmosphere, and relatively reasonable too.If we lived in Gent, we would be regular customers !"
"Had lunch with my family at this little gem.
Ordered lamb and chicken dishes..
Well cooked and great taste. Will visit again."
"The hosts made us feel welcome, the service was prompt and there was no delays. Even down to the topping up of the wine glasses, we didn't need to lift a finger. Will go back"
We came here with a large party of Belgian friends to celebrate a 75th birthday. The service and food were excellent.
We visited for dinner. Blown away by the setting and food. Very imaginative set menu that was simply divine. Wine flight was delicious with info given on each wine by the owner. Generous servings. Also discovered the joys of Belgian gin here. The service was excellent and I cannot fault this place. Only wish we had stayed in Ghent longer to go back again. Excellent in all ways. 
"Invited by friends in what one should call a private dining session we've been welcomed in a very warm way and immediatlely directed to the dining room for our aperitive. Large choice exposed on a tall table. Once choosen the wine we've received very fine, delicious an well mounted food, and this on a normal closing day. to be continued!"
Great food & friendly service in a casual atmosphere. We’ve enjoyed the whole evening.  All different flavours were a delight for our taste buds!
"Just accross the Mariott Antonio and his brother run this small r'staurant for many years. You can get the classic pizzas, which are excellent but you can also opt for a typical dish of their region of origin, Puglia. For the wines ask Antonio, he always has some local Puglia wine to offer. This is a nice place to go to, reasonably priced with a cosy atmosphere. A personal favorite for years."
"Last night during the lightfestival in Gent we had an excellent diner at the Faim Fatale. The restaurant is located near the theater in the centre. When you enter the restaurant it feels like home as it's decorated in a stylish living room, complete with fire place. The service of the owners is very good, they really enjoy it and serve with a smile. Then the food, i had the carpaccio for starter and seabass for main course. The food is of excellent quality with pure and nice flavours. The starters were a bit small, but were compensated with a bigger main course. We will be back next time and maybe take the the surprise menu of the chef!"
"We visited the restaurant for a meal for two whilst in beautiful Ghent. The staff were amazing and the food was fantastic. We followed a number of reviews on TA and this was the best experience by far. We had Flemish Stew and Waterzooi both lovely local dishes cooked to perfection. It's a shame it was our last night otherwise we would have visited again. Still, it was a great ending to a few nights away!"
"Choice of four different soups, served with fresh warm bread rolls and a kiwi. Really lovely. 4 of us had different flavours, tomato, pea, leek, paprika. Would definitely recommend this place."
We came here a couple of times with a large group of friends and were never disapointed. Great food at reasonable prices and delicious meats. The staff was also friendly!
Nice food... nice tastefully done restaurant and very nice and hospitable staff ... the owner was an interesting gentleman... would recommend to go again..
"This place never disappoints: the steaks are cooked to perfection, the fajitas are very good and we absolutely love the baked potatoes.Children portions may be a little bigger but we take 3 for 2 kids and that's ok.The atmosphere in the restaurant is fantastic but I even more like sunny evenings on the terrace."
"Very cool experience to do with friends! They have a selection of a lot of different beers! Not being a beer-drinker myself, I enjoyed the time we spent there. As it is usually busy there in the afternoon, we went upstairs (not signposted very good). If you are sitting upstairs, a waiter will come to you to take your order. If you stay downstairs, you have to order at the bar."
lovely food great staff undercover from sun and if you get a shower great chiefs always there to help very busy place
Just finishing my dinner.supper donot like to move from here.food is wonderful and service too well decorations feel like i am at nepal.
Best Thai of Flanders in a very nice setting in the middle of the marvelous historical city of Ghent  !
"Great sushi! Great service! I took the the Tokyo Combo, which was nicely presented and tasted great! Location was perfect as I was staying at the NH hotel (great hotel, different review). Will come back upon my next visit to Ghent."
"Delicious wines, friendly service
nice place
in summer very cosy to sit outside
its nearby the center, so definitely worth a visit!"
Although you can spend more money you can get a great breakfast bargain here- €2 for a cup of coffee or tea and a croissant or two small pastries. Croissant was very good. 
We found this restaurant a bit by accident and ate there two nights in a row. The first night we decided we only wanted a 'small' meal and ordered what we thought was sufficient. It was huge and delicious. We had a Tapas plate to share and chicken wings and chicken quesadillas. Way too much but we were able to take the tapas with us for lunch next day.Next night we both had the steak on lava stones! Fabulous! We had seen others having this and looked fantastic. We were extremely happy with our selection.Staff and Owner are all friendly and attentive. Prices are reasonable.Would happily recommend to anyone. Will come again when next in Ghent.
"It is always a true pleasure to see Alain the chef. His classics are great, such as pepper steak, steak tartare, blue lobster. Fantastic terrace outside"
We went to the 't wokske for dinner.A nicely presented meal.The couple that own and run it were amazing. They are not young but managed to get the meals on our table in good time.The food was amazing.I had the duck and orange. The flavor was very suttle but I could taste the orange in the sauce. The duck had a crispy skin and was cooked just right. A big meal but so nice.My husband had the duck with coconut milk curry. Suttle taste again but he said it was absolutely fantastic and the duck was so tender.All at a very reasonable price for Gent.It is out of the tourist area but well worth it. 
this is a new indian place which have opened in the city centre of Ghent.IM SO HAPPY that i found it. Food is incredible (and i go to indian restaurants really often).I had saag paneer and naan bread and both were just as i wanted them.What i like about this place is that it is spacious and you actually do feel like in a proper restaurant.I highly recommend this place
"We arrived in Gent quite late and the owner, Frank, at our Hotel couldn't recommend anywhere to eat on a Saturday night so we decided to go for a walk. We caught the No 1 tram towards the city centre and accidentally got off too early.What a find!, We thought that it looked a bit cheap but decided to give it a go...good choice. I ordered a pizza (massive for one person) and my wife ordered the lasagne (which I was lucky enough to finish for her :). I ordered the Siciliana and, not being able to read the menu, was horrified to find it had tuna on it (highly allergic). I ordered the same pizza again but without tuna and although not I insisted that I pay for the first as well, they would not charge me for the first, telling us that they give them to a homeless person when he comes around at night.The pizza was fantastic! A big call considering we had just spent a week in Stresa (go there, seriously). The crust was light and the ingredients were fresh. I saw the cook shaving the leg of proscuitto and lengths of salami on the slicer before putting on the pizzas. My wife's lasagne was deliciously creamy although it didn't have enough meat in it for her liking. Including two soft drink and a carafe of house wine, it was only 32 euros. A bargain.If you are in Gent and are looking for a great meal at a very reasonably price, try here. Service was great and the food was better. ONe warning though, the menus are in flemish, ask, don't guess or you may end up with tuna :)"
"I have been there 3 times and every time had excellent service and fantastic food with matching wine. Really worth the visit. People  are very friendly also and service is ideal! 
Food is just amazing!"
"A great restaurant where they know how to makee perfect steaks and other dishes, theres also fish for those who dont like meat. Very friendly owner and staff, attentive and helpfull. Waiting times are perfect, the food is done as you ordered. Prices are normal. A great place top have dinner."
"Great service fabulous all you can eat ribs, baked potato and very fresh salad. Reasonable prices. Highly recommend if you are in Gent."
Super good food. It is located in center. We had momo and chicken tandoori. Very authentic taste. I will definitely come back. Highly recommended for fine dining.
"Can't remember how I found out about this wonderful restaurant, but not to be missed unless you want just a single plate of food. The menu is fixed as 4 or 5 courses for the evening and every dish was a delight for the eyes and the taste., accompanied by the most delicious home made bread. Service was efficient and dishes explained in English as they were served. Very small number of diners so booking essential but you can check using web. The evening menu starts at 49euro with a little more for a cheese plate or an extra course, choose your own wine or pay for selected wines.I now have some great cooking ideas ! If you can't get a booking (and it was a relief to find the place open during 10day Feest) you can drown your ambitions at the friendly Folklore bar just across the tram tracks from the street to Roots"
Nice moderen design at first sight. The waiter suggest me to take duck with 8 soft taste. It was wonderful .
"This fantastic cooperative, produces a range of different vegan meals. I am vegetarian, and usually a little sceptical of visiting a single cuisine restaurant. However this charming place, completely changed my opinion. Good, honest and delicious food for all. Top tip (as all menus are in Flemish):Take a plate or bowl. Fill with as much or little as you want from the hot and cold dishes. The price is based on weight. "
We visited to watch a match and have a few beers. There was a nice selection of beers and a good bar food menu. The table service for beer was very good as you could relax and enjoy the match. The staff were very friendly and done a great job of keeping the drinks flowing. 
"There's almost a secret entrance to the restaurant making the occasion feel extra special. The space is small, low-key and modern with simple, tasteful decor. The service was so professional: confident and attentive without being over-bearing. We were there for over 3 hours and one bottle of wine lasted 2 of us the whole evening! (Not sure if the sales manager would approve!) It was beautifully judged: the sommelier poured the wine and took the bottle away, always topping up at just the right moment and I never felt that we needed more. We opted for the 6-course tasting menu with amuse-bouche to start; each course was delivered and explained by a chef. From the restaurant, you can see into the kitchen where the staff painstakingly prepare each beautiful dish. Everything was exquisite and surprising; textures and flavours carefully considered. The only downside was that I felt some of my chicken course (a very small piece of the breast) was slightly underdone. I didn't mention it, but when clearing the plates the waiter asked about it and we were later served coffee and cake on the house. The whole experience was wonderful and one I'd definitely repeat once I've saved up enough money!"
"Amazing waffles, particularly with strawberries and ice cream.
Couldn't believe that they were able to get better strawberries than we have in the UK - we visited 3 or 4 times and they were always fantastic.
Very helpful staff an a brilliant location."
Great ambiance and great host with authentic Indian food. A must try if you are Indian food lover. Nice location And cosy interior. Highly recommended
"Bright, helpful staff and wonderful food. The Stoverij was absolutely fantastic and my wife had a really nice Sole one night. The warm apple tart was pretty good too.
We were always welcomed and accommodated, even during the busy festival season.
And a great location"
"Beautifully appointed interior with comfortable seating and open fire. Situated in a building of historical significance, the owner happened to be there when we visited and he took delight in answering all our questions and explaining the architectural heritage of the building and the history of its founder. The food was good, the restaurant specialises in chicken dishes but there was something for everyone. A great selection of beers, including Orval - which feature on the drinks list as well as in the menu with several dishes incorporating either the Orval cheese or the beer itself. There are strong historical links with the Orval Monastery."
".. better than all the rest. Restaurant Horseele plays in a different league!! Top gastronomy served in a very stylish environment. It reminded me of ""Commerç 24"" in Barcelona but than with a greater variety.We had the ""impressies"" menu with the wines proposed by the sommelier, who put a great effort in explaining the reasons for his choice. Truly a divine dining experience worth the money. I praise the day when chef Dany Horseele decided to come to this city. For visitors unfamiliar with the town, don't be put off by the fact that the restaurant is integrated in the new soccer station. It is easy to find and you can park in front of the very entrance to the restaurant. Just remember to drive all the way to entrance H !!"
This was our second visit to this restaurant. First time was in same month of 2015. We choose the selection of 3 types of madurated meet . The wine  was a 2017 Syrah from the Chilean winary Matetic
Authentic Indian food and with great service at a great location. Owners are friendly and reaching out to ensure dining experience is of quality. Very satisfied.
"what a marvelous experience ❤️
the tastes of food and matching sake, the cocktails, the passion of the team, the ambition to excel, the quality of the whole setting, the room with a view on the garden ...
it all works
we'll be back !!"
"Great foo, creative kitchen and friendly staff in the city centre of Ghent. Parking is the only minus."
"We were a party of 15, from various countries, different dietary restrictions, and with two children. Because of our size we had a pre-set menu for all. When the waiter, Peter V. realized that some in the party could not eat a particular dish, he quickly served an alternative without calling any attention to the guest or the issue at hand. What a professional! Peter also spoke a number of languages, and of course spoke English fluently. The food was excellent, with classic Belgian dishes included. The location in Korenlei right along the canal is wonderful. As we were staying at the Marriott right next door, this was also convenient!the decor inside was very pretty, as well. Again, the service was top-notch - smooth, with all meals arriving on time, and everyone attended to. I was so pleased, I gave Peter a Tripadvisor pin. It was a fun moment. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special meal, or entertaining clients or guests."
"This is our favourite Turkish restaurant in Ghent. They have a good selection of meat dishes, fish dishes and pizza's. It's not the most refined kitchen, but you get extremely good value for money. The interior is rather dull, but the food packs flavour!"
"excellent selection of wines, aperitivi & digestivi! super pizza. small menu, but evrything is authentic and VERY good! the mixed bruschette are the best we ever had outside and inside Italy! good place to go to in summer when you have kids or grandkids as they can play otuside.we love that place!"
"book in advance as this place is always fully booked, because they have a friendly staff and good brasserie menus in nice atmosphere"
"The restaurant is in a amazing area and not to hard to find. The staff was very friendly spoke good English and offered great service. I would highly recommend trying the Babe Burger, prepare for a large delicious burger one of the best I’ve ever had "
"A casual but excellent restaurant serving wonderful Belgium food. My wife had the salmon (she eats lots of salmon in lots of restaurants) and said that it was among the best that she's had. I had the Chicken Watersooi - a kind of a chicken stew. It was delicious. They had a wide variety of beer (it's Belgium, after all) and a nice selection of wines."
"We ate at this restaurant today for lunch in Ghent. It was a last minute decision to visit Ghent so we had done no research for suitable restaurants. We stopped here as it seemed popular and was a nice location. We weren't disappointed! We couldn't speak Dutch so found it hard to work out the specials board but the waiter was very helpful and gave his interpretation despite looking uncomfortable. His interpretation was spot on!! All four of us went for the specials and no-one was diss appointed. All meals were excellent - cooked to perfection and well presented. My daughter and I had the burger and I have to say it was the best burger I have ever had. Well cooked beef, no bab and an exquisite sweet tomato sauce. I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant for a lunchtime stop. You won't be disappointed by the food."
"Amazing food, great hospitality... The owners were kind and the atmosphere was great! We had a lovely time! Definitely recommended!"
"We turned-up on spec and we were fortunate to get fitted-in due to a cancellation. It’s an interesting building with somewhat ‘steam punk’ decor - but none the worse for that. The staff were welcoming, attentive and very able throughout. The food and drinks were excellent as well. We really enjoyed our meal and hope to return."
"Very popular cafe restaurant serving very tasty food - as a non-vegetarian, the vegetarian options were superb. 

Good value, relaxed surroundings, good location."
"My friend is Irish and wherever we go we are looking for an Irish pub to find some delicious food ! We weren’t regretting our choice. The waiters were very welcoming and perfectly English/Flemish As usual in a Irish pub there is comprehensive for diary problems and we were nicely served ! My friend took the burger and as for her stating the meat was so tender and perfectly cooked ! I took the salmon salad with some toast. The salmon was definitely high quality I recommend the pub for ambiance, good music, welcoming staff and excellent food !"
"Been here a few times with friends. It has become my favorite pub. Best burgers in Ghent! Great atmosphere, friendly people, great during EC... just... Speechless :-)"
"The restaurant is hidden behind the market, a very quiet yet fancy place .We were sitting inside but the tables outside were gorgeous too, especially because the weather was sunny too. The atmosphere inside was great and trendy , the whole concept of the restaurant was very nice. The waiters were very kind and attentive, they recommended us the right beer for each of our preferences. Absolutely gorgeous food - We had the mussels, the lobster, and the sirloin steak. Each dish was amazing!!! Especially the steak - so tender and juicy, it was just right! The price is totally acceptable and worth it, for that quality of food! I'd love to go there again if I get the chance to return to Ghent."
"Food spot on - staff friendly -  spoken languages were Flemish, Dutch, German, French and English. If you don't eat massive meals don't have a starter. The deserts are sublime."
"An authentic Italian fried pizza, which was very tasty and light. The place is not far from the city center. It is worth a visit 🙂"
"I never go to Italian resaturant when i am abroad. this time I must admitt...it has been amazing! Sue and Raffaele are very friendly, the ambience is nice and fresh....the food is simply amazing. Follow Sue's suggestion and you'll love it. I cannot wait to be back to Dolce Far Niente!"
"I am only just getting back from my anniversary dinner at Gillis, and I already miss this restaurant. From the atmosphere to the service to the food, this was one of the best restaurant experiences of my entire life. We were greeted by such kind people and given an amuse bouche of house made sausage and apples, which was oh so tasty. The owners who assisted with our order, and served us, were extremely warm and helpful. You are able to choose cuts of beef from different regions of Europe, and I can confirm, these were the most amazing steaks we had ever eaten. We ordered the charcuturie as well to start with, and it was absolutely fantastic! The meat croquettes with jamon iberico were incredibly delicious. I truly can't say enough positive things about this restaurant. We were both overwhelmed with emotion these steaks and this experience were that good! (anyone who truly appreciates good beef, will understand). I must say, if you are anywhere near Ghent (this is worth a day trip from Amsterdam or any other nearby country), please go, go, go, go here! We hope this restaurant is around for a very long time, as we will need to return."
"My husband and I visited Royal India. Despite a busy Friday evening the host took very good good care of us. Instead of having us wait outside for a table to open, she got creative and at least got her order in before we could even get a table. We tried the Aloo Gobi, paneer tikka masala and both were great. The paratha and Roti would especially great… Reminded us of home as it was whole wheat and nicely toasted. Definitely coming back here if we visit Gent again!"
"We were unable to book on specific date required as we had left our decision to eat here a bit late. Made a reservation for the following evening and we were not disappointed. Food and drink were very good, within our expectations, with a comprehensive menu. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I have a disability and they could not have been more helpful in finding appropriate seating. Unbelievably they offered to give more of the main course that I had chosen even though the original portion was very substantial, regrettably I had to decline their very generous offer to make space for dessert . It would appear that many of the "" locals"" use this restaurant which may be a good guide."
"We went to Du Progress because a Belgian friend told us that they serve very good traditional food and they do. 
As it was season we had white asparagus which were delicious. 
Prices and portions are fare."
"I was too late with my question for a gluten free pizza, as it takes three days to make the dough., but I was able to bring a gluten free dough though and my FODMAP dietary restrictions were respected with a great sense of creativity."
"Well how better then to say it with a proper welcome in Thai language to Kin Khao, to the list of my favorite restaurants This Restaurant gives you a true Siamese culinary experience and with proper authentic Thai food.You do not find such a succulent and delicious choice of Thai food very often and in particular so far away from the country of origin!The chef put a lot of passion in the execution of the recipes and I wander if the hands of Mama are also involved in selecting the ingredients with such meticulous attention top detail.I have to point out Larb Moo which is a typical pork salad with an explosion's of flavors and truly magnificent!You can always make the distinction from the average to the great when finding a true and proper Massaman Curry and their version with chicken is AMAZING! Massaman incidentally is amongst one of the 10 best flavored dishes in the list of best foods. Everything else we tried was properly executed.There is a nice selection of carefully priced wines to accompany your meal but really the best part is the food which with a nice Belgian beer is the best of the pairing with all these spices.My compliments to the Chef owner and perhaps to his Mama for bringing the full flavors of Thailand to Ghent."
"we went for the 3th time, but now on saturday noon. price quality is this for me the best restaurant of Belgium or even Europe. verry high end. a wine list that blows you away and the plates are pieces of art that explodes inside you mouth. we went for the 5 courses menu including the wines. top top top. also the hospitaliy is amazing !"
"Google says open until 11:30, so I dropped in around 10 but I was told the kitchen was closed. Might want to post kitchen hours separately. Anyways, the restaurant was decorated beautifully and the setting very nice. I was able to get an order of hummus and they gave me a bunch of pita bread. At only €5, it was presented beautifully and it tasted awesome. They were very hospitable even though I sadly only spoke English and couldn’t communicate much with them. Overall, I look forward to returning and trying all their other food, as the people inside that were finishing looked like they had awesome meals. Definitely recommend this spot, their hummus was awesome!"
Picardie is located right off of the main walking area in historic Ghent. The terrace is large and packed with tourists and locals alike. The Waterzooi is really good. They have a nice selection of local beers including Gents Triple. Service is fast and friendly. Our server spoke perfect English ( since we were obviously struggling with Dutch!) i highly recommend this place
This bar is a real old school bar with multiple floors. They sell a huge selection of local beers with a small description written next to the beer. You can really tell that the owner knows a lot about beers!
"This is hidden treasures close to Ghent with a soul and amaizing tastes. The staff is very friendly. The cook comes to the table to explain dishes. If you wanna feel Amaizing and like Realy VIP you cannot miss this restaurant. Reserve before hand and enjoy oerfect high class dining in beautiful decor. We loved it, i celebrated my b day here and we come back! "
Du Progress is located in the lively town square of Ghent. We ate there on a wonderful fall evening outside. The staff was wonderful my wife and I had the local dish waterzooi which was delightful. Overall a great choice if you want to sample the local fare in a fun location.
My first time trying Belgian style fries and we really loved them. My wife and I shared one medium box and it was more than enough as the serving was generous. The fries were crispy and there was plenty of sauces to choose from. The location is perfect for a stop while you are strolling the old city.
"We thought we'd give it a try as being British but living in Gent meant we are always looking for good Indian food. The Royal India did not disappoint. A super friendly husband and wife team made us very welcome and the food was heavenly! Such great portions meant there was enough to take home and eat for lunch the next day. They even make their own paneer. We love the fact they have vegan, and veggie as well as meat dishes on the menu, and their roti bread was out of this world. We are back again on Friday with more people. Can't wait. We have found a gem in the heart of the city."
"We popped in here as we did not want a full dinner just a snack.A really nice place with good service and tasty food, we had bruchetta and prawns to share along with large amounts of white wine, the food was good and fairly cheap, well worth a look"
As a Belgian who lived in Malta for many years...I really did enjoy our dinner here. Food is prepaired with passion and I coudnt fault them in any way. The layout of the restaurant with the kitchen directly adjacent to the dining room is nice as you can glance into the kitchen to see what the chefs are upto. Highly recommended! Will go back next week!
"food was great - good service and very pleasant surroundings. The staff (father and sons I think) were very amusing, hot headed Italians who bickered amongst themselves! All adds to the atmosphere though."
Modern décor with a modern menu. Tried the Tasting menu at euro 75 which was 6 dishes all of which were excellent. Some had a twist which was very pleasant to try. A totally different approach to steak tartare and even the oysters had a twist.
"We had Ghent Amber beer and fish fondue for two people with white wine. As a compliment, we got a bite of crab salad each.The evening was a bit chilly, but heaters and quilts for sitting outside were perfectly enough. Staff was attentive but not distracting us too often.And we could watch the sun coming down, reflecting in the waters of Leie. Awesome experience all in all."
Was a funny evening in Ghent. I Dined at the Martino for the first time in about 3 years. Again a fantastic meal at a good price! Was served by Pascaline who was a joy to both myself and French girlfriend - whose father is Pascal ironically. Would really recommend this resto to locals who haven't been or to anyone travelling through such as myself - check it out for quality food & service for good price!
"Whenever I'm in Gent, I always visit the restaurant at least once a month. The strength of this restaurant lies in the combination of offering a different menu every month, which gives you 3 choices per course, which can be combined as anyone of your company likes - and this for a very reasonable price. So if you're 3 people, you could combine 3 completely different menus - or someone could just pick from the a la carte while the rest of you go for the menu. This kind flexibility is almost impossible to find in similar restaurants.Because of the ever changing menu, the chef is taking risks. So I 'm willing to forgive imperfections. It's easier of course to create a perfect menu which stays on the list for the whole season, but that would be boring for repeat customers.The food itself was spot-on on my last 3 visits (rating of 5)Many times it can be a rating of 4, and once in a while you could be unlucky that it is average - that's a small risk for being rewarded by flexibility.Service : staff knows their job, no complaints. But as with any restaurant : I prefer to come early to avoid the crowds.My conclusion : best value for money if you want to go as a regular customer and like the relative freedom to combine your own menu."
Came here for a late night snack. “Bas” was working and he was the nicest! So happy and he did such a great job making our food hot and fresh. The fries were awesome and he made all our food super fast. These are the best fries we had in Gent and I can’t recommend this place enough! Five stars and a great experience!
Staff were welcoming (rare for Gent) and they accomodated twelve of us in a semi-private upstairs room. A few nice starters on the menu which were well presented and which they kindly split when they realised most of us were sharing them.Mains were a different event - I'm not sure I looked past the steaks and couldn't guarantee that there was anything else on the menu - Maybe some pasta? Great steaks choices and sauce options - I had the Fillet with a sauce that wasn't James Bond as everyone else was ordering that and mine was beefed up with mushrooms. Cooked to perfection and with the optional side salad or vegetables (Vegetables option much larger and v.good).Beers kept flowing and don't think I remember any starters being ordered. A couple of hours later an average bill and we were all as happy as cabbage patch kids and trundled to see some Gent nightlife.Would recommend.
"Loved this place food was fresh healthy and very tasty. Great price definitely worth a visit. Alternative fast food, you can even take away the soup in the big tubs they provide"
"Last week I was there with friends and I enjoyed a lot.The burgers were super good and the onion rings very tasty. The service was also friendly.Definitely I will come back!!The only negative point... is that you can't make a reservation, so you have to go early or wait until a table is available."
Very nice atmosphere for a drink and snack! Beautiful building with a DJ in the evening. Definitely going back next time we are in Gent!!
"While in Brussels, we dined here. The Greek dishes we had were outstanding. The waitstaff was very nice too. We had the souvlaki and pastistio and both were delicious.  We would definitley recommend this restaurant.... and that is given by someone of Greek heritage."
"Indian restaurant very nice food. Great flavors, not greasy, good portions and fair price. Main course between 13 and 20 euro. Very friendly personnel. Defenatelly a recommendation!"
"A classicly styled European bistro that has an excellent quality foods, wine and service. We arrived later on in the evening and our B & B gave us a coupon for an apertif of Cava which was lovely. I then had the chicken breast fillet which was called Ferme and is famous for it is the worlds only certified breed and is recognized by French chefs as AOC. My partner enjoyed pork knuckle and thoroughly enoyed his meal. Book in advance and it is an experience not to be missed while in Gent."
"Took shelter from the rain today and popped into this fabulous place. Lovely food, very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. Would definitely go again."
"very tasty dishes to share, a cozy environment in this relatively small resaturant, and friendly staff."
"The owner of the B&B we were staying suggested we try this restaurant. It was during World Cup so the owner had installed a very large tv for the locals. We did not mind the excitement. The food was excellent all prepared by Marc the owner. He gave us a tour of his kitchen which was very clean during the rush. We had a house special of shrimp but the best was the pork ribs. I know good ribs and these were fantastic. Not BBQ prepared as in the States but probably the best I have ever tasted. He seasons them with a secret spice recipe and would not reveal it to me. The menu prices were a surprise, not very expensive. We ate and drank well for about 55€. The bartender was very helpful and both he and the owner spoke excellent English. Marc even offered to lead us into agent the back way to the best section of town with good parking. When we return to Belgium we will join Marc for dinner once again. P.S. Belgium beat the USA in their World Cup match-up"
"We came across this place just by chance wondering around. We both opted for a pizza, a vegetarian and a capricciosa (meat) the crust was very light, the cheese wonderful, lots of topping. For the two of us including soft drinks it came to €30. The wait staff were patient in explaining the Flemish words that with our French/German skills we couldn't place. Well recommended."
"People may not know this, but many restaurants in this area are closed on Mondays which made this place a real find. The staff were kind, friendly and attentive towards us. The portions were substantial, steaks were cooked to perfection and the curry scampi (king prawns) was very tasty. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, although get there early or pre book as they close at 9.30pm and at least 15/20 people were turned away. Website http://www.tstoveke-aalter.be/menukaart/ to look at the menu."
"Klaverblad offers a causal dining experience with a tinge of fine dining. The food served is terrific especially the welcome appetisers that totally open ones appetite. The staffs are friendly and provide great services, especially Hana who took time translating the menu to us in english. Hospitality and warmth are definitely of utmost importance to Klaverblad.I will definitely dine again at Klaverblad if i drop by Belgium again.P.s Without reservation, please walk in early to avoid disappointment. The place fills up from about 7 in the evening."
"Every time when we want to eat a tasty meal - we go to Multatuli. Guaranteed quality and cosy atmosphere and good service. Combination, that is not easy to find among Gent restaurants. There are many, but not many offer great quality of food and service. My favourites are Stoverij and Goat cheese salad. Very nice selection of beers. The only little minus is difficulty to park around. But for a nice meal we can as well walk a little:)"
"It is worth a visit here just to admire the architecture. Had drinks and appetizers here with the family in the bar area. It was comfortable and a nice atmosphere. Service was attentive and advised us well. I haven't had oysters this good, ever. So we ordered another plate of them. Had other appetizers which were also delicious but can't remember what exactly. However, the oysters won't ever be forgotten."
"After having visited quite some of the better restaurants in many larger towns, this time I finally succeeded to have a (business) lunch at Kelderman. I can only regret that it has taken me so long to book this restaurant as it has many advantages. Not too large or too small, much parking space, close to the E40, cosy and of course an exquisite lunch for a reasonable price. From the beginning you feel comfortable and the food itself does not need much comment as the strength of the chef is serving fresh fish. To be repeated."
"Hidden away in a residential neighbourhood, this fairly new restaurant (opened about 5 years ago) offers excellent gourmet style French cuisine made by someone who really has the top chef qualities. Delicious seasonal ingredients, friendly staff, modern design interior, lovely garden, so worth the detour from the highway! Prices are reasonable, as example a lovely two course lunch with a glass of fresh white wine from Rueda, Spain, and coffee including some delicious dessert samples and a lovely amuse bouche to start with for 30 euros was really worth the money. Hope to come back soon!"
"Extremely fresh sushi, delicious warm food and lovely staff ! 10 on 10 for sure !
Perfect Nigiris ! Must do when u in gent en u love sushi :)"
"Great brunch options in saturdays and sundays. Cosy garden, news papers and books available and wide variety of drinks. Great place to drink and relax outside the city center!"
"Great steak, nice service, attention to details and very good quality/price ratio. Definitely recommended!!"
"The hotel we were staying in (1898 The Post) recommended we try this restaurantYou really need to have faith when you walk in through the unassuming door. We actually thought we had come to the wrong place when we finally found it. Inside it’s a different world. Beautifully decorated with flowering trees (sounds odd but works). We decided to have the tasting menu and it was a great decision. Started with smoked salmon, followed by Thai beef salad, then huge prawns. The fourth course was Mexican spicy chicken, and the fifth and final dish was aubergine pasta. All dishes I probably wouldn’t have chosen from the menu, however each course was delicious. The accompanying bread was clearly home made and extremely tasty. (Especially the brown bread, could have devoured a whole loaf!)To finish a gorgeous chocolate mousse. Absolutely loved it and would recommend it to everyone. Service was perfect. Just enough time between courses and the waiting staff were a delight. Very reasonably priced too - just €32 each. A must if you are visiting this beautiful city."
"De Stokerij is a bit hidden but worth the 'search'. It's a beautiful restaurant with lots of industrial and rustic touches.Not only that, the food is great as well. Refined, great taste, anything you want for a good night out. To top it off, the staff is friendly and helpful.Go!"
"This restaurant is in an area of Ghent where most tourist probably wouldn't venture and there are a number of Turkish restaurants in the same area. Akdeniz doesn't look like the most modern restaurant nor the most inviting so you might want to pass it over. Don't.I was there with family for lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was very quiet, I've been told it's much more busy during evening services. Service was great; very helpful and friendly (not to mention quick) and the food was delicious.We all selected Mezze Akdeniz which is basically a platter of just about any kind of Turkish food you can think of and while Turkish food is typically not my favourite, all of this was really good.So even though it's not in a tourist area, go visit it. It's only five minutes walk from the Friday Market or Patershol area and it's well worth finding it."
"We were walking through Gent on a day trip, heading for the museum. Thirsty, we dropped by what looked like a little bar on the outside of the fine art museum but was really a restaurant. We couldn't resist having lunch as the menu was enticing. Lovely fish with asparagus and other delightful sides. Delicious kale soup. A surprise amuse bouche (ok I can't spell that) and great beer. Attentive service. The kind of Belgian food that delights. Would happily go back. Only complaint is the age-old one, if you choose to eat outside and enjoy the sunshine you are surrounded by cigarette smoke which rather destroys subtle flavours. "
"The restaurant Amadeus in Ghent is really interesting place because of the interior decor and the speciality : grilled ribs in honey. We eat not only ribs, but also waterzoi. Both dishes were very good. Waiters are nice and friendly."
"A fantastic dinner, excellent Entrecote with perfectly cooked hot legumes.
A warm professional welcome.
Thank you"
"For of us having sushi here it was fantastic,one of sushi we never had another place ,different teste  this is shadow on TripAdvisor but best one a real."
"Nice ambient wine bar with outside seating - perfect for an early-evening drink before dinner. Some unusual choices and the aperitifs good too. Service excellent too, very knowledgeable about the wine on offer."
Genuine and fresh Indian food in a small restaurant close to the touristic centre. Friendly staff and trendy setting at affordable prices.  The thali has limited but very tasty dishes.
"I keep going back to this restaurant
Always busy with couples, families, young and old
Services is good and very quick. 
The pizza is amazing, massive and always comes with a nice salad
Very good value for money"
What a marvelous jewel hidden in the side streets of Gent!  The family who owns the restaurant are so gracious and wonderful and the food was so most incredibly fantastic!  What a wonderful find!  We shall return someday.
"I can't think of anything bad to say about this restaurant. We had an excellent dinner with excellent drinks and an excellent service. The interior is beautiful, the service is calm, friendly and on time. Every detail is thought of and perfected. We will definitely be coming back!"
"Great steak on charcoal grill. Comes with lots of sides too. They have a few types of steak in different sizes. I was hungry and went for the large Argentinian one and didn't regret it. It looks like they have a large selection of wine. I had beer, so I can't really comment on that. The service was fast and polite."
"This was a treasure of a find! Happily satisfied one of us who is gluten and dairy free (including Belgian beer) and a vegetarian (and beer lover). Delicious, well presented food. Friendly service. Gezellig atmosphere!"
"On New Years eve, we visited this restaurant with our family. Reading the menu did set our expectations rather high and they got all fulfilled. The food is really exquisite and served in a modern and cosy interior. The appetizers, amuse-bouche, both fish and meat were incredibly tasty and have great textures. All is served with excellence and in a reasonable time between the dishes. The host made us feel welcome and explained each dish in detail. Definitely a place to return to."
"Called briefly into Ghent and found this restaurant by accident.Great find - busy lovely place run by trendy waiters with an excellent menu (albeit no English version).Croque Monsieur and coffee for both of us which arrived and was delicious. Would point out that there three ""halves"" each so plenty for a snack and the total cost was over £26.00."
"In the middle of center of Aalst, you can find this typical “brasserie”, very nice staff, good belgium food and a lovely atmosphere.
Highly recomended."
"Ate here on a cold, snowy day and it was the perfect antidote to the weather outside. A lovely, cosy restaurant with a homely feel. Amazing food - I had the beef stew and my friends had steak. Good quality meat, tasty and well presented (and good portions). I can definitely recommend the creme brûlée & chocolate mousse, they were delicious too.And on top of that the service was warm & friendly. A really great meal all round. Would highly recommend. "
"First time in this fabulous part of Ghent: great pub, excellent music, bartender Anton is a delight! Unfortunately no Leffe..."
Spent a great afternoon on the canal-side terrace sampling the wide variety of Belgian beers and waving at the canal tour boats as they passed by!
"This restaurant looks very tiny from the outside, as do many of the restaurants in Ghent, but once inside it opens up. The outside deck in the back is right on the river and has some great views. The food is wonderful and creative."
Excellent vegan restaurant: good food in buffet formula: all you can eat. Make sure to make a reservation.
"This property has an excellent location overlooking the river in Ghent. Belgian food was nice, but we needed a break and this restaurant had an inviting look and nice Italian menu. Food was quite good and moderately priced. The owner was charming, gregarious and greets you in English or Italian if your Flemish is lacking. A fun place to eat."
"We had a drink outside earlier in the day and we were very taken by the attitude of the staff. We then returned later and found it to be very busy. I was recommended the speciality of the Ghent stew whilst my husband had the curried scampi. The meat in the stew was of very good quality and just melted in my mouth. Good friendly service , all the staff that dealt with us spike excellent English. Would return without any hesitation "
"The best Sushi boats in Gent! Just ""the"" sushi restaurant, don't look any further. Friendly personel."
"I alwats enjoyed this place with the wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff and good food. Highly recommended."
Always a treat to drop by for lunch here. Can fully recommend the 7 course meal with accompanying wines. The setting is dreamy and the service is impeccable.
"We weren't sure which restaurant in the area to choose but weren't disappointed. Good atmosphere, great friendly and helpful service and food and wine good quality. Quite pricey but worth that bit extra. We all (4) went for the set menu which was 28 euros plus an extra 20 euros each for an aperitif, wine (as much as you wanted) and coffee. Food we all said was really good with a welcome choice of white and red wines. Service was not rushed at all. Would definitely go back."
We live in Ghent and typically avoid this area for lunch or dine because it is too ´touristy’ ...  however we had AMAZING food here!  Good ingredients selected with care and skilfully prepared and served with a smile.  Just perfect!  We will be coming back!
you can sit eat and watch the world go by the foods fantastic and the location so tranquil watching people go by and on the canal too people are so friendly and the place is so comfortable
"Have a break from off-the-chart nutricious Nutella waffes, chocolates and Belgian beers that local food industry is offering from every other inch of the city. Also, have a break from hefty prices that come with places like ""a restaurant where waffles were invented"" or ""just a touristic place with a view"". Spup lounge that modern hip thing: easy lightweight design, simple unsophisticated healthy food. Say no also to lengthy menus with cryptic food lists, it is simple down-to-point choice: a choice of soup with up to five fillings. Soup comes in 0.5 or 1 l for little price (5/6Euro), a descent value — especially comparing on ""Gent average"". Granted, it is less nutricious that a load of waffles, handful of chocolates (you possibly can not afford tons of chocolate with those price tags in Leonidas) polished by whatever you found on a touristic ""beer tour"", but it definitely will make you feel that this once, you were in harmony with healthy living. Also close to the river and all the nice places."
"In stark contrast to the previous review left by one of my compatriots, I have nothing but praise for this restaurant. We visited on a busy Saturday lunchtime and the service was excellent despite the busy restaurant. We ordered the beef stew, vol au vent and ribeye steak and everyone was very happy with their food. The chips were magnificent, especially when deployed as a Belgian chips and gravy combo (using the stew sauce as the gravy). Great beer, excellent Belgian meat dishes and spendid chips. That will ding-dang-do for me. "
"The square outside Du Progress is crowded with restaurants and since all of them has pretty much the same tables and chairs its hard tell which is which. We got good service from the waiters and due to heavy and dark clouds we moved inndoor. Chateubriand for (four adults)us and spagetti and burger for the children, with drinks and wine sat us back €135. Not steep for a rank 4-restaurant. Extremely delicate and tastefull food. The portions was too big, enough for 7-8 people. The waiters also gave touching attention to our children; crayons for drawing, dessert and a heartshaped lollipop. "
Having dined here repeatedly we have enjoyed continuous high level quality both in terms of food on the plate and all round dining experience. Well run restaurant providing smooth friendly and discrete service in elegant surroundings. Above all inventive cooking at a high level of execution and taste. Elaborate and very attractive plating adds to the excitement of the overall dining experience. High end prices but definitely value for money with numerous small amuse bouches and palate neutralisers included in the well structured menus. In short an all round great dining experience.
"We visited Ghent for the Christmas market and met up with our son who recommended and booked this restaurant. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is located just off the main square, in a road behind McDonalds. The restaurant looks to be a converted warehouse with a balcony overlooking the entrance. The place was full at lunchtime with people waiting in the road.The choice of food was a good balance between meat and fish and the price middle range, not cheap, not expensive. Portions looked big so my wife chose a crab salad with apple and curry which she loved and avoided a main course. I decided against a starter and went for the knuckle of ham main course which was delicious and filling. We tried the local beers with the meal.Overall, very happy with service, food and ambiance. Would I go there again? You bet..."
"This place serves a great Sunday brunches budget for 32.50euros. That insides a prosecco, orange juice, hot drink and a lot of good food. Like crossaints, chocolate, cheeses, meat, chicken, salads, bread etc. Very yum, I filled my plate thrice! Indoors is very sweetly decorated and there is a nice garden. You can come with your whole family, your love or friends. I wouldn't recommend going solo like I did, you will be the odd one out "
"Very good food!
Don't go here if you're in a hurry or if you are really very hungry.
Otherwise just enjoy the service and nice atmosphere."
"Excactly what it says to be: a beerhouse.
They offer a great variety of beers, including local and self-brewed beers.
The finger-food it good value and also local specialties. We had the paté."
Absolutely loved it! Athenthic decent cuisine at good prices and amazing service! Definitely recommend
"Following the reviews on Trip Advisor we chose this restaurant for our last night meal in Ghent. We did not book but were there early evening and managed to get a table; were were there late September 2013.The fixed price menu was good value and the service was exceptional; attentive without being overbearing. The proprietor was speaking English, French and Flemish with ease and took time to explain the menu to us.We would definitely go back if we are in Ghent again."
"The food here tastes very good and fresh, the service is friendly and modern.  Trendy interior!"
"Dinner date at il sogno. Lovely first course (bruschetta with tomato and parma) and very delicious main course (boyfriend had the lasagna, i had penne arrabiata)."
Very fine Indian restaurant. Owner gives good advice about the meals. Very friendly. Situated in Central Ghent. Prices are normal
"Really nice spot with great view, just above the river. 
Great variety of drinks and reasonable prices too ."
"What a pleasant surprise to discover this restaurant ! Very friendly staff, excellent food and great wines. Don't be afraid of the small portions, together with all the superb apetizers it's really more than enough ! We took the menu with apero, waters, wine and coffee / tea for 71 euro/pp and it was really great value for money. I will come back !!"
"I will remember this meal for a very long time - truly fantastic. I'm really angry that the only other English language review on here complains about this place - the guy clearly doesn't know fabulous food when he gets it! There is no menu as such - you eat what you're given - but we had four courses of Thai food that was of such complexity of flavour and quality of cooking and ingredients that we were in awe. If you like Thai flavours and spice, I doubt you'll eat better outside of Thailand honestly. The other review talked of portion sizes, but each course consisted of three small dishes (except for dessert) and each dish was a crafted masterpiece. Service included the chef coming to your table to explain each dish. They ranged from oyster in a Thai sauce, to scallops to beef jerky in an incredible tomato sauce. Wonderful place in the fashionable Patershol area not far from Gent Castle and historic centre. You MUST eat here!"
"This place was recommended by a local I met. Very small but charming restaurant with 2 super-friendly guys running it. They are not Japanese but the food is the real thing. Homemade noodles, perfectly made ramen bowls, with or without meat. I had the tofu w/egg option, and for €14 I was definitely filled up. Will be back."
"Have been here for many times and have rarely been disappointed. The food offering is mainly very normal Belgian cuisine brought with extraordinary tastiness and freshness. The very kind and personal service has always been exceeding expectations for a much frequented restaurant of this kind.The only negative thing maybe is that the place is quite small yet very successful, so it can be a bit busy and overloaded at times. I'd even recommend getting a seating at the bar if you're just a couple."
"Nice interior, excellent food and very friendly service. Prices rather high but in line with the quality they offer and thus acceptable. Highly recommended for lovers of exceptional, high quality cuisine."
"everything was perfect ,the meal, the restaurant but you have to take reservation a long time before you get it."
"Lovely little restaurant in a relatively quiet side street near the centre of Ghent. The courtyard is nice and shady on a hot evening. The menu is small but appealing (and includes children's options) and the food, which came quickly, was delicious.The staff were excellent, especially as our two year old was taken ill during the meal, they were friendly and relaxed about the whole thing.Wholeheartedly recommended for families!"
"Waffles with Red fruit sauce & Ice-cream is just woww.. Very delicious
Nice location in Ghent center. Fast service and friendly staff"
Been coming here for years and it’s still so good. Their style of broth is so rich and creamy. Can’t be beat.The service is great. This can be quite busy so you aren’t always sure you can get a table but the staff really try their best to keep things moving without rushing the customers. Also the ice tea is amazing and you can also get it in larger bottles to take away.
"Visited this restaurant with 4 people and were very satisfied.This building is a mix of style and nostalgia.I was living until my 37 years in Zele so I know the setting, it's the old ""spinnerij"" Van Der Eecken, one of the famous usines.You can see that the visual concept is very important because its fascinating how they kept the Original building, doors...We took the 6-course menu and the food was very exquise, fine dressed and tastfull.With the first and fourth rang you even received 2 separate dishes.Service was a little bit cool but by the end it went a little bit smoother and relaxer.The chef himself served often the sauces and kept an eye on the service.The wine map is very good (not so expensive) and there are even 4 wite wines of Austria.Excellent resto and I wish all the best at these young people."
"Stumbled across this little gem and decided to head in for some lunch. Nothin disappointed! The pizza we had was one of the best we had ever experienced, based on the Mexican nacho dish it was like nothing else! Totally original ideas on the menu and amazing flavours! The outside courtyard area is a perfect area to relax and grab lunch and a beer whilst relaxing in the warmth the enclosed area provides. Staff were friendly and attentive and also explained the concepts on the menu fully. We loved this place so much we went there twice on a 3 night break! "
"great setting, even better food in the new, 'naturalist' style..."
"It is the first time I visit Ghent and it is one of the most beautiful cities I saw and one of the greatest experiences I had. The food is good, the service fast and friendly. I recommend it. :-)"
"All dishes were perfect: presentation, taste, ... and all for a very good price. The portion were large, so you will not be hungry when you leave here. Although I had enough with a starter and a main course, I couldn't resist to take a dessert as I was to curious for the taste of it :-)The place itself is very romantic if you have a table for 2, but also larger groups can come here. this is not disturbing for other people. I surely will come back here!"
"Situated in the centre of the town, this restaurant has very atmospheric decor - all sorts of bits and pieces everywhere it almost looks like a museum. We arrived just after they had opened and had no trouble finding a seat. The staff were friendly and attentive throughout the meal and gave great advice about what beers to drink with what food - they even have their own beer and we bought one of their special glasses to bring home. There is a large selection of meat displayed in a chiller cabinet and they will talk you through them all and you can then choose what you want and how thick you want the steak. You can also choose from a good selection of Flemish specialities. We both had a steak with peppercorn sauce which was tender and tasty. We didn’t really need one but we had a dessert anyway. Great food and service, we’ll definitely return next time we are in Ghent."
During a bike ride we required lunch. Spotting the Passé-Vite we stopped and looked through the window and liked the decor and the fact there were plenty of customers.We sat down and was treated to a delightful lunch. The accompanying dishes with the meals were very generous in portions and the main courses delightful. House white was a delight and the overall experience was more than simply satisfying.Full marks from me
"Tucked away down an embankment this little spot is huge inside. Great for music and decent snacks and drinks too.  

Had to ask twice for milk so nothing terrible and staff were really friendly and it looked as though they actually enjoyed working there too."
"Having lunch at Pakhuis is amazing. There is a good lunch-offer with tasty starters and main courses which you can complete with a glass of good wine if you wish so. Together with a friendly service, this is all you need to enjoy a couple of nice hours in this extraordinary setting"
"The best indian food I've had in Belgium! We were in Gent for a day trip and ended up here while they were almost closing for lunch but still accommodated us which was very nice of them! Having had food made by Nepalese everywhere in Belgium, this was such a welcome change!Food was of great quality and so was the ambience and service. Dal was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this place! "
Seat by water.  Many beers.  Helpful staff.  Sausage and cheese with a nice mustard.  Who cares if it is tourists.
We had a good experience and the service was excellent The manager was really attentive and definitely we experienced mini India. .We had super food and the starters were with green chilli sauce so it was really yummy.Overall it was charming n satisfying
"I went here for lunch with a friend after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. I was actually expecting to be dissapointed ((after such good reviews, you can only be dissapointed oif the slightest thing is wrong, right?) but boy, how wrong i was!There is not a single thing about the food, the setting or the staff i can give a negative comment about! It was superdelicious for VERY reasonable prices with two waiters whom were some of the friendliest i've ever had.The only slightly negative point for me is the bathroom: when you go into the bathroom, there's a stall for female/male, but you actually pass an urinoir as female before you get to the stall. I think this could be a little embarassing if someone was actually using it as a girl walks by. But that's the only possibly negative thing about our ENTIRE stay, i can honestly think of nothing even remotely bad about the food, atmosphere, staff or prices..."
Peter had spotted it by chance. We went for lunch and soon found out why it was VERY popular with the locals. Think about a pleasant canteen where all the delicious organic food is laid out in containers. You take a plate and pile up what you fancy eating. At the cash desk your plate goes on the scale and you are amazed it's only €8! The cake type desserts are so good too. Lunch for two €26It's not a place you can book but there are lots of tables. Mon to Sat 12-14.30 & 18-20.30lekkergec@yahoo.com
"Ordered India Palace starter, butter chicken and chicken biriyani as main dish. All the dishes exceeded our expectations by far!! Perfect use of spices and masala, perfect cuisine, it was delicious! We will definitely come back here!! Namaste!!"
The best Italian you can find! Spoil yourself. We experienced the delicious food and exceptional hospitality!
The atmosphere is very calm and refined. The food is excellent and the service is friendly and attentive. I always go if I am in the area and know I will be served a wonderful meal.
"Very nice street corner pub/bar in Ghent. Proper pub/bar atmosphere, quite dark and cozy which I like, good choice of beers. I had the 'Super 8' IPA. delicious! More seating upstairs but be careful as very steep staircase. (Everywhere in Ghent seems about 10% - 15% more expensive than in Brussels). Friendly staff too and good service. Happy to speak in English. "
"If you like ribs and are not afraid of using your hands as tools this is the place to go.When we were there they had 4 all you can menu, spicy, maison , honey and ""au naturelle"". We tried then all, but i must say that my favorite was the maison version. Have a look at their website to see their most updated menus. The waiters make sure that your plat is never empty!I advise to make a reservation, since the restaurant tends to be crowd on Fridays and weekends."
Vibrant atmosphere with a gorgeous view to the castle. Wide variety of good and affordable Belgian beer served by a friendly staff.
Warmly welcomed restaurant where quality is served. Very sympathic family business. A true enjoying of meals and kindness of the family 😀 A happy visit!
"Located in the old Patershol area of Ghent. Walking past during the day you could easily miss it. The front houses a different bar/restaurant. You walk through a courtyard with tables outside and into The Baan which has a rabbit warren of rooms. The staff were charming and we were quickly shown to a table even through we didn't have a reservation. Nice simple decor with Thai touches. Drinks arrived promptly. I chose prawns to start followed by Red Thai Curry of Sea Bass. A large, boneless fillet in a paper thin batter, drizzled with sauces and plenty more to pour over. Fresh and perfectly cooked with not too much heat, as the waitress had explained. Quite simply the best Thai food I have ever eaten. If I lived in Ghent I would become a regular."
"Even though it was a very busy weekend in Ghent (Gentse feesten), the staff offered a great service, starting from our arrival. Ordering and serving was fast and the meals were great. I can recommend the antipasti plate as starter, good tastes and a lot of food. The beef stew with Gulden Draak beer was delicious as well. Combine it with good drinks and you have a very very good dinner. A place to remember!"
"Second time we were here. Both times the food was great. Took the Culinairy journey menu with wines, if you want, you end up drunk.

this is a great place to spend some hours enjoying food!"
"Had dinner here on a Monday and the restaurant was packed. Nice atmosphere, very friendly staff and the food was amazing. Can certainly recommend the tuna, which was excellent. Will definitely come back again."
I found this with my family at Easter and ate there twice in one weekend and when we returned this weekend I had to take our friends there. Anya is front of house and is very polite and professional. The food is outstanding. The chateaubriand is fabulous and the Ghent stew/casserole is beef in a type of gravy/sauce that must have been cooked all day - melt in the mouth. You must go!!
Everything people say about this place is true. Yes the beer is overpriced and the place is filthy and unhygienic......it is also enormous fun and you are likely to meet other people there who are also looking for somewhere different. I don’t think I would want to stay there all night but the large bottle of beer we shared was worth every cent. I have been in hundreds of bars and pubs in my life. This makes it into the top 5 memorable places. Just go there and see for yourself. If you don’t like it there are plenty of more ‘normal’ places nearby...
Ordered steak tartare with white wine. Both of us loved it. The interior has charm and it seems very popularwith the locals. Make a reservation for lunch or dinner. There are fixed times for lunch. However one can sit on the sunny terrace which is very nice on a sunny day. Primarily a fish restaurant and excellent quality. This is not the first time we visited and we make a point to always drop in if we are in Ghent.
"The restaurant promised and delivered a gastronomic experience, and we also got an environmental experience. The decor and the food were well-matched in casual elegance, and the three of us had a memorable canal-overlook table of the water activity and across at the stone Groot Vleeshuis (Great Butchers' Hall) as the day slid into twilight.As a starter, we ordered the restaurant's version of Vietnamese spring rolls, which gave a preview of tastes to come through the translucent rice-wrapper and the open ends: Tofu that was a pleasure for non-tofu eaters and an unusual and flavorful combination of greens and herbs and pineapple(?) with the rice noodles. Before the spring rolls came out, there were unexpected, delicate mussels (moules), and after, there was a fine white-wine/citrus sorbet. I had ordered the lightly grilled Dover sole with spring vegetables and received the sole meuniére instead, but didn't protest; it was a light and gently salt/peppered pleasure with frites and salad. Dessert was an enjoyable mix of small meringues, mascarpone ice cream, berries, chocolate crumble, and more (photo).Service was ""languorous,"" ending with a temporarily lost bill, but we were relaxed and happily unhurried and unfazed."
"Visited few times. It's conveniently and beautifully located, with superbe friendly service and food which rarely disappoints. Recommended for all kinds of lunches and dinners. Fresh food."
Well worth a visit. Excellent food with generous portions at a very reasonable price. A bit out of the way but worth the walk visited on a Saturday in early February and had no trouble getting a table at 8pm it was busy but not full up. Good beer selection. 
"We stepped in around 14h30 and still were able to eat a late lunch. The waiter told us that the owner recently changed and I must say that the quality of service was excellent, unlike some reviews I read on Tripadvisor. Also the price/quality of the food is great. My girlfriend ate lamb chops and I had some vol au vent. The lamb chops were of exquisite quality and grilled to perfection. My vol au vent was also very tasteful. Enjoyed my stay here very much!"
"The restaurant was closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so we booked for Monday. It is probably best to book, although I think we could have got in on spec. We had the fixed three course menu for 30 Euro. Excellent starters with lots of care put into the preparation and presentation. I had soup followed by fish, my wife had duck; at all stages the staff were keen to describe the dishes and were very helpful, polite and welcoming. You felt they wanted you to enjoy yourself. Could not fault this restaurant."
"A relaxing Sunday lunch time spent with family. There was a great selection of cold and warm choices in the buffet, all with amazing flavours. Discrete service kept the dishes topped up and then came the desserts (remember to leave room). Coffee and tea on tap and a fresh orange juice to start. Best to book in advance.highly recommended."
"Perfect place for a nice business lunch. Friendly, classy and great holiday-feeli terrace and good lunch. Hot weather = Mediterraan 2 dish lunch. Top."
"Found this little gem thanks to my rule of not eating at motorway service stations. I was traveling from Germany back to the UK and decided to head of at the next junction and find somewhere for a spot of lunch. I was lucky enough to find this place. I was welcomed by an older gentleman who asked if I could wait for a colleague who spoke better English as my Belgian is non existent ! He showed me to a table and helped me with the menu and made a few recommendations. I chose a scampi in a curry sauce with beansprouts, onions, carrots and lots of lovely fresh herbs. It was beautiful, light and fresh and a perfect balance of flavour with delicate curry flavour enhanced with fresh herbs. Accompanied by perfectly cooked frites, as everything in Belgium should be ;-) Highly recommended. "
The food and wine are extremely well presented with pride. We took a fixed menu which included selected wines with each course. My wife and I had been before and knew it would not be cheap. We invited 4 friends and were slightly embarrassed as the price was considerably higher than we had remembered.Thoroughly recommended for the quality of food and attentive service. Worth checking which menus are available at what price before booking.
"A restaurant with modern interior design, serving good quality Indian food. Tried curry chicken and vegetarian curry, which were really good. The owner was constantly attentive and very friendly"
"Had a great evening here with a group of 11. Staff extemely helpful, food great and building lovely!"
"Glad we saw this little gem on trip advisor.
The food was absolutely delicious and full of flavour, service was excellent, friendly staff, the owner is a bit of a character full of fun, well recommended."
"While there are many options on the menu, I chose to have some authentic Belgian food since this was my first day in Ghent. I had the waterpooi with chicken, a type of stew with vegetables and tender chicken. They served a gigantic portion, but it was so tasty I nearly ate it all. It came with flavorful rolls that tasted fresh baked. And of course I washed it down with a delicious local beer. My spouse had steak and frites, and he loved every bite of it. Our server was friendly, multilingual, and quite efficient. We sat outside in the tables facing the plaza, and the people watching was perfect."
"When here for early dinner, we sat outside, it was sunny, the service is excellent, opening course came fast. I tried seafood pasta and their signature pizza. Everything is on point. The house wine is good. Price is good. Location is in the center. Recommended!"
"Lovely service, wonderful mystic interior, super tasty and healthy food prepared and served with love.We were a group of 14 (4 kinds included). First we had to postpone our reservation- no problem - kids were provided with drawing material and were served primarily. We all had a wonderful evening with tasty homemade juices and a great and extraordinary setmenu."
"Great food, warm welcome... A place to come back to. Had a wonderfull meal with a friend... Stayed for coffee and walked out happy"
"Absolutely delicious flemish stew, so tender and with a clear flavour of beer. Also tried the onion soup, it was delicious. A reservation for Saturday night is recommended, because it is a very popular restaurant. Very helpful and kind stuff. The prices are normal for the quality of food. It is a very friendly place. Wish I had the opportunity to visit again for the ribs."
"Been here several times already, yesterday with a Thai friend who works in a restaurant and she was really happily surprised of the nice dishes they serve here. You taste that they use good quality meat and vegetables. They have a big menucard but whatever i taste is always done like it should be, quality and a pleasure to eat. Owners and staff are friendly, helpfull, attentive.. Prices are perfect for what you get. If you like Thai food or want to try.. place to be."
"I have just recently traveled back to Ghent and, having been so impressed last time, had to stop by this place for a steak. It didn't disappoint. The waiter was friendly and the food was amazing."
"Unlike many other Indian restaurants, they don't just show you the meat in their curries. Their portions are generous and tasty. The staff is attentive."
"My wife & I hadn't been here for 10 years and we were so pleased nothing has changed.Perfect service, great wines, house beer & wonderful food. This place is really good for sea food but the red meats are also good.A friendly buzz in here; families, couple & old friends meeting but you need to book. Easily done on line from the UK."
"We have had a fantastic dinner paired with very good wines! All was perfect ... we sited under a winter garden, outside was raining but we had the sun in our dishes! Fish and meat were dancing together in perfect harmony during all the dinner! Everyone should try this superb experience! Thanks Chef, thanks to all your staff."
We were a party of 10 who recently celebrated a birthday here. I cannot say how impressed we were with the food and the service. Each course is explained in terms of what you are eating and similarly the wine … where it’s from what grapes used .. it all adds to the ambience of this restaurant. Service is fantastic but not intrusive . Timely intervals are left between each course and nothing is to much trouble. You really feel special and spoilt .
"Good food, good service, good pricing! Enjoyed all of it and i'm definitly going back! I appreciate the fact that you can put together your own salad, good concept :)"
Welcoming Cafe in Ghent near Train StationArriving off the Train with luggage & unsure of next step we walked into ‘Het Beleg Van Gent’. Plenty of room to bring our luggage in. Staff very friendly & helpful with their English. Ordered Hot Chocolates & they came with an extra glass of Chocolate pieces to make them stronger if needed. They were delicious. Ticket system for trams was explained to us. Toilet inside Cafe also.
"Very cozy place. The people are very nice and polite. The food and coffee are very nice. Amazing for breakfast and brunch
The vleesje and the pancakes are delicious."
"The Bridge is one of several restaurants right in a row on the square in front of St. Baafs. The restaurant has a cafe portion, but we chose to eat indoors to be warmer. We ordered the most expensive salads we've ever had in our lives, but they were large, delicious and among the least expensive items on the menu. I had the Salad with Goat Cheese, that was covered in sprouts and had a wonderful flavor. My husband's Chef Salad with shrimp was as attractive to look at as it was delicious to eat. But, the real treat was the dessert. We ordered the Mikado Waffle, which had vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on top of a large, delicious waffle, and came with dark chocolate to pour over it. Absolutely wonderful! "
"We first noted the Vier Tafels in the afternoon when we were looking for a nice place for a drink. Looking through the windows we noted the coulorful patio. The drinkt were fine, the service good and the menu intriging. The same evening we went back and enjoyed the hospitality, great world food, and relaxed atmosphere. During dinner we noted many people looking through the windows as we did earlier. But many descided to move on. I felt like pulling them all in. When you visit Gent, visit the Vier Tafels. Talk to the friendly hosts en enjoy their meals."
"Highly recommend stopping in for the great selection of draft beers and bottles. The meat, cheese and olive tray is a wonderful compliment to the beer! Wonderful patio setting in the square by the Butcher’s Hall!"
"This is one of the two Amadeus in gent, one is near the Cathedral, this is near the Gravensteen. This one has itself another ""dependance"" wich is located few steps far from it. The restaurant has a pleasant old-style atmosphere, with bear glasses hanging from the ceiling and soft lights. The ""house speciality"" are the spare ribs, which you can eat as much as you like for 15€ (also available a children formula). The ribs are cooked with the BBQ sauce and are very tasty, even if a little bit hard to digest. they are served with salad and baked potatoes, and thei are replaced as soon as you finish them. Sadly, there are too few beers in the menu. Anyway, staff is really nice and value for price excellent. They can accomdoate also groups of people. Remember to book online in advance on their site, especially during the week end (impossible to find restaurant in Gent on friday and saturday night without booking)."
"Went there and just stopped for a snack and drink. The service is very pleasant. The atmosphere of the place is nice and trendy with natural vibes. The products offered all seem good and attractive.

We recommend for a stop or gravbing something to eat."
"Last minute dinner plan resulted in an excellent evening with a delicious meal in wonderful restaurant in my home town. The staff is very professional and knows it's stuff without being pushy. Additionally to the restaurant there is al lovely hotel in which we didn't stay but got a small tour after our dinner. If your a tourist coming to Ghent or just a food lover or gourmet do come here someday, you won't regret it!"
"Soup was absolutely comforting.

Pad thai was so delicious, red thai curry could have been a bit more spicy but that is preference. Food was presented beautifully.

The staff are really friendly and the whole vibe was authentic."
We were made very welcome and the waiter spoke very good English.It had a comprehensive menu to suit all tastes.Food and service were excellent. A great find in the suburbs.
"I had a great lunch at Royal India. First, I had a special chicken soup with super fresh coriander and then butter chicken with a magnificent red sauce. I also ordered delicious garlic naan. Huge portions. I was completely satisfied. Thank you so much."
"Very high quality steak, super friendly staff. I really recommend it. We enjoyed it and will certainly come back."

"Every season high quality menus, but also à la carte very fine meals. The service is top and very friendly."
"I was here only once for a colleague farewell lunch. The service was exceptionally good, and the food tasted awesome!"
The ambience of the place is exquisite and the food is delicious. Atmosphere is warm and the staff is very friendly. Services are quick and commendable
"There are lots of places for breakfast in Ghent, all priced within a few Euro of each other. Don't miss this one! Like the set of Mr Selfridge, Downton Abbey and Brideshead Revisited all rolled into one. Impeccable service with nothing too much trouble for the flamboyant hosts. We had the mini breakfast (apricot and apple blossom or strawberry and rose petal jam anyone?) , which was ideal for our needs, but the more exotic ones looked absolutely staggering. An unforgettable experience!"
"Had a quiet and excellent evening at this beautiful place. Great and original food, honest wine, clean place, and all that for a very reasonable price."
"Milkshake was really good, had fruit pieces. Apple pie was tasty. Personnel was friendly and helpful with our 2 buggies and 3 young kids."
In february 2013 we ate with a group of 10 in this restaurant. The ambiance was great and the service of our waiter was excellent. The food was well prepared and very tasty. The winecard is very complete. We had a very fine Rioja. I can recommend this restaurant when visiting Gent wether you travel with two or with a larger group. 
"We popped in for a couple of takeaway pizzas - the restaurant was full but we were welcomed warmly and waited only 10 minutes.
The pizzas were excellent!"
"Awesome fresh bread, cheese and ham and great value for the money -- wonderful brunch experience or whenever you need a meal -"
Cannot stress enough how fantastic the food is in this restaurant. Steak was better than any I have ever had and we live in London. The Roquefort sauce was to die for and the house wine was an amazing match for the steak. Do not go to Ghent without going to this amazing restaurant. Customer service was exceptional. They put up with our rubbish English attitude of 'if you want to speak to me speak English' and had a ready made English menu. The atmosphere was beautiful and Icannot wait to come. Both Ghent and this restaurant were amazing. Thank you for the best start to our holiday.
"A spontaneous visit on a sunny noon turned into a great culinary experience.We were able to have lunch outside under the sunshade, without reservation. We ordered à la carte, my husband chose fried mackerel as a starter, I went veggie with burrata, tomatoes and basil. It was a very refined sensation. The mackerel was only superficially fried, beneath that it was soft and tasty my husband said. My burrata melted on the touch of my tongue. My dish was sprinkled with coarse sea salt, just enough, not too much.As a main course my husband had the Argentinian steak, I chose the chili sin carne. They didn't ask my husband how he wanted his steak, but it arrived in perfect saignant cuisson nevertheless. My husband enjoyed his steak as I tasted my chili sin carne, with sour cream. Nice combination of flavours, I liked it.For dessert we both shared one portion of some kind of crème brûlée with lemon curd. Again we were very much pleased with the sensation of flavours.We left very pleased with the discovery of this restaurant."
"Staff polite and graceful. The restaurant is elegant and very well located, close to the most popular places in Ghent. Food is amazing. cheese crocket is the best ever... And they have a T bone you can eat dreaming...Highly recommendable."
